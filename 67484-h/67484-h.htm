<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Philip Perry</span> and Sydney Monroe are
young officers in the United States navy.
Although they have been out of the Naval
Academy less than two years, and are still
ranked as midshipmen, they have seen active
service, as related in &#8220;A United States Midshipman
Afloat&#8221; and &#8220;A United States
Midshipman in China.&#8221; &#8220;A United States
Midshipman in the Philippines&#8221; tells how
Phil, with Sydney for executive officer, commanded
a small gunboat in expeditions against
the insurgents. Boatswain Jack O&#8217;Neil has
been with the lads in many of their hazardous
adventures, and the three are now on the
&#8220;U. S. S. Alaska&#8221; in Japanese waters.</p>

<p>The story deals with a misunderstanding
between the United States and the Island
Kingdom. This complication causes a few
days of anxiety to both nations, and gets some
people into serious difficulties but, needless to
say, it is purely fictitious.</p>

<small>THE MAN IN THE NEXT COMPARTMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and
there was unusual activity in the railroad
station at Yokohama. Uniformed officials
were scurrying to and fro, bending every effort
to dispose of the great crowd of stolid Japanese
travelers and at the same time, with due
formality and ceremony, provide a special
train for their lately arrived American naval
visitors.</p>

<p>So painstaking and anxious were these energetic
and efficient little personages to please
those whom their government had chosen to
honor, that suddenly, at a signal, they stemmed
the great influx of their own people, sidetracked
the steady and ever-increasing flow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
bright colored silks, and did it as easily as if
they were but putting a freight train on a
siding. Not one murmur was heard from the
crowd delayed so abruptly; the travelers
waited, talking and laughing joyfully. To
them it was all pleasure. There was no
necessity for haste. When the honorable railroad
officials were ready, then there would be
plenty of time for them to get on their trains.
They had no thought of questioning the acts
of their Emperor&#8217;s officials, who wore the imperial
badge of office&mdash;the sixteen petal chrysanthemum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such docility on the part
of a traveling public?&#8221; Midshipman Philip
Perry exclaimed, gazing wonderingly at the
good-natured, smiling faces of the Japanese
about him. &#8220;Imagine, if you can, a New
York crowd waiting like this at the Grand
Central Station for a dozen Japanese officers
to board a special train.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipman was one of a party of
American naval officers, recently arrived in
Japan, and journeying as the guests of the
Japanese nation to their picturesque and
historic capital&mdash;Tokyo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Lieutenant Hugh Winston, one of the party,
smiled knowingly as he read the wonder in
the eyes of the two youngest of the party,
Midshipmen Perry and Sydney Monroe.
Winston was an officer of some years&#8217; standing,
and the character of the Japanese subject was
one with which he considered himself on very
intimate terms, after three cruises on the
Asiatic Station in American war-ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can compare the Mikado&#8217;s loyal subjects
to no others on earth,&#8221; Winston returned.
&#8220;Every man you see in this crowd has served
his country as a soldier or sailor. All recognize
an order when they hear it, and I can
tell you they obey, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was small doubt of their obedience.
The good-humored crowd, increasing in numbers
every minute, stood in orderly merriment
watching the tall representatives of the United
States of America, led by obsequious railroad
officials, pass through their midst and into the
coaches of a special train. Following the
handful of naval officers in their severely plain
civilian clothes came many score of American
men-of-war&#8217;s men dressed in the picturesque
sailor garb, while walking hand in hand with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
them the little Japanese sailors, the hosts of
their giant visitors, appeared in striking contrast.</p>

<p>The congestion in the traffic of the Tokaido
Railroad was soon relieved; a shrill whistle
from one of the officials&mdash;and immediately the
wheels were again in motion and the patient
Japanese were once more on their way to their
waiting trains.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Japanese crowd has no terrors for the
public officials,&#8221; Lieutenant Winston said by
way of information, as he and the midshipmen
settled themselves in one of the compartments
of the tiny coaches of the train. &#8220;In Japan
discipline begins at the mother&#8217;s knee. Filial
obedience is part of their religion, and they
are taught to obey their Emperor as the father
of them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always heard that they are classed
among the best fighters in the world,&#8221; Phil
Perry said admiringly. &#8220;The fighting man
with them is in a class by himself. Isn&#8217;t it
so?&#8221; he asked the older officer at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Samurai,&#8217; or fighting class, is the
aristocracy of Japan,&#8221; Winston replied.
&#8220;They symbolize the fighting barons of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
middle ages; quick to resent an insult or
avenge a wrong. Their code of honor is
centuries old. These are the men you will
meet in Tokyo. The naval and military
officers are all recruited from the families of
the &#8216;Samurai.&#8217; You will see in them the
most polite of a polite nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the object of the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;s&#8217; visit
to Japan?&#8221; Sydney Monroe suddenly asked as
Winston ended his eulogy on the Japanese
race. &#8220;Our relations are not over friendly,
if we can believe some of our yellow journal
newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not to be discussed except within
an air-tight cell,&#8221; Winston returned gravely,
a warning ring in his voice. &#8220;We are here
on a friendly visit to be present at the garden
f&ecirc;te of the Emperor of Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train had glided out of the
long, low station shed and picked its way over
a score of tracks to the one leading straight
to the metropolis and capital of the island
empire. Stations, consisting of miniature
structures with their long, narrow platforms
came noisily out of the world ahead and were
left behind with a waning moan as if in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
protest at being given but a fleeting glimpse
of the big strangers.</p>

<p>The conversation had come to an abrupt
stop after Lieutenant Winston&#8217;s words of
caution and the three Americans sat silently
gazing out of their open windows at the ever-changing
landscape.</p>

<p>The sailors with their Japanese escorts were
in the cars ahead where they were leaning
far out of the windows, excitedly acknowledging
the &#8220;banzais&#8221; from the groups of
peasants who had collected on the station
platforms to see the Americans pass.</p>

<p>Philip Perry restlessly left his seat and
walked slowly along the narrow aisle of the
car. He noticed casually in passing that the
door of the compartment next their own was
closed, and the blinds drawn. The other two
compartments he saw were empty, for the
railroad officials had provided more than
sufficient accommodations for their party.
He reached the car ahead, and stood gazing
for a second at the sailors within. Retracing
his steps, he stopped at the side of the car
opposite the compartment next his own.
Suddenly he was conscious of a voice coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
through the compartment door which from a
closer inspection he now saw was only ajar.
The train had slackened its speed, then
noisily stopped. While he listened the voice
died away, and he was on the point of going
to the platform to ascertain the cause
of the stoppage of the train when the voice
that had attracted his attention began again,
this time clear and distinct. Phil unconsciously
listened, believing the speaker was
one of his brother officers, but what he heard
caused him to catch his breath in surprise.
He held himself rigid, straining to hear every
word, while his indignation showed plainly
in his set features.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baron, every day you put off this inevitable
war with America makes Japan&#8217;s
chance for success in the Orient the less,&#8221;
were the startling words that Phil heard
spoken with a marked British accent. &#8220;Now
the opportunity is given you. Her fleet is in
Manila, all naval men will tell you that it
must be at a great disadvantage. It lacks
supply ships and torpedo-boat destroyers.
Your fleet is here at your source of supply.
Depend upon it, Baron,&#8221; the voice declared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in excited, eager tones, &#8220;this cruise has
come to mislead you. America knows the
danger surrounding her fleet. She has
blundered in sending it so far from home,
and now wishes to safely withdraw it, or
strengthen it with the Chinese ships. It is
one thing or the other. You must increase
your efforts with the ministers if your dreams
are to be realized.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart beat wildly as he stood listening,
hardly daring to breathe lest he should
betray his presence before he had heard all.
The same voice was again speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know that whatever America
will say, it will be insincere. America
covets the entire trade of China, and unless
your nation halts it as you did Russia she
will through her rapidly growing wealth
accomplish her end. She is negotiating for
the Chinese battle-ships while this cruiser
here will endeavor to allay suspicion. Unless
Japan acts promptly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a succession of jolts the train was
again noisily in motion, and the door of the
compartment swung shut with a spiteful
click. Phil was trembling with excitement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Here on the threshold of their visit he had
surprised a plot to force his country into a
war. What should he do? He could not go
openly and accuse those in the compartment;
that would be dramatic, but would be
barren of results. His best course would be
to discover the identity of the speaker and
the man addressed as Baron, who Phil knew
must be a Japanese nobleman, and then
warn his captain of the conspiracy on foot.
But how should he be able to discover
their identity? Who could tell him their
names?</p>

<p>He could pretend to enter their compartment
by mistake, and impress their faces
indelibly upon his memory, to be used at
some future time. With this object in view
Phil placed his hand on the door-knob trying
to turn it, only to find the latch had fallen
from within. Frustrated, he stood thinking
excitedly as to what his next move should be.
The door of his own compartment suddenly
opened and Sydney Monroe, his companion
and classmate at the Naval Academy at
Annapolis, gazed in surprise at the stern set
face of his friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Phil?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;You look as if you&#8217;d just seen a ghost.
Nothing&#8217;s wrong, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil held his hand up for silence and
entered his own compartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are people in there,&#8221; he exclaimed
excitedly, indicating with a nod, &#8220;whom we
must recognize and remember. It&#8217;s the most
barefaced case of conspiracy that I&#8217;ve ever
known.&#8221; And then he detailed almost word
for word what he had heard.</p>

<p>While he was yet talking and his two companions
were listening eagerly, consternation
growing in their excited minds, the train
again came to a halt, but for just a moment,
and then was off again.</p>

<p>A few minutes later it was plain that the
country had been left behind and that the
suburbs of Tokyo were at hand. The train
passed through row after row of tiny wooden
dwellings, built like card houses, appearing to
be ready for some giant hand to smooth them
flat. On sped the train across miniature
stone bridges and through beautifully laid
out parks, until a sudden screech of the
whistle and the gripping of the brakes announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
that the journey was over, and
Tokyo had been reached.</p>

<p>Phil scarcely waited for the train to stop before
he was in the passage, gazing about in the
gloom (the passage being unlighted) for the
occupants of the next compartment. Its door
stood open, but they were not there. He
rushed to the platform, but he saw no strange
faces, only his brother officers and the sailors.
What could it mean? Then he understood
the meaning of the stop only a few miles before
the train reached Tokyo. The occupants
of the next compartment were men of consequence,
and even a special train ordered by
the Emperor of Japan could be stopped at
their will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shan&#8217;t forget that voice, anyway,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed disappointedly to his companions
while the three moved slowly toward
the exit gate.</p>

<small>IN THE EMPEROR&#8217;S GARDENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;If</span> we could only have had a glimpse of
the man&#8217;s face,&#8221; Phil Perry exclaimed dejectedly
as the three naval men who had occupied
the compartment together were driving
rapidly from the railroad station. &#8220;Who can
he be, and to whom was he talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>The streets fronting the depot were filled
with a curious and enthusiastic crowd of
Japanese, and as the Americans passed
rapidly through in victorias, their mafoos
wearing the royal liveries, the multitude gave
voice to their welcome in repeated and prolonged
shouts of &#8220;Banzai&mdash;Ten Thousand
Years of Happiness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give yourself too much credit for
discovering a plot,&#8221; Lieutenant Winston returned
sceptically, after their carriage had
freed itself of the crowd and was moving
along a quieter street. &#8220;What you heard is
only the usual stereotyped opinion of our so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
friends here in the Far East. The
European merchant and also the European
resident in the Orient are trembling for fear
the United States may get all the trade of
China, which she might readily be doing now,
if our merchant marine were equal to that of
Germany or England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that has any bearing on
the subject,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, somewhat nettled
at Winston&#8217;s tone of patronage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply that in order to put us out of the
running they are doing their best to talk
Japan and the United States into a war,&#8221;
Winston replied. &#8220;To your face they are
very friendly, but, behind your back! Well!
it&#8217;s really best to refrain from hearing, if you
can, for it&#8217;s never complimentary. They
don&#8217;t love Japan any too well, but the grasping
Yankee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he ended with an expressive
wave of his hand, for the crunching of
gravel under the wheels of their carriage
drowned his voice completely. They were
entering the courtyard of the Imperial Hotel.
A few minutes later all had alighted in the
spacious lobby, and were being led ceremoniously
to their rooms, engaged by the imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
government, whose guests they were as long
as they remained in Tokyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are doing things lavishly,&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed, after he had surveyed the street
from his window. Great crowds of eager
people had gathered about the hotel with
small American flags in their hands to bid
their guests welcome, while the avenue beyond
as far as the eye could reach was festooned with
the colors of the two nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a program of our entertainment,&#8221;
Winston called from his room adjoining.
&#8220;They are certainly most hospitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney looked closely at the
printed program which the servant had
brought them. It was carefully and handsomely
arranged, giving a sketch map of
Tokyo with all the important buildings
marked, and the locations of the numerous
places of entertainment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think we were foreign princes instead
of only common every-day naval officers,&#8221;
Sydney said as he finished reading. Phil&#8217;s
face was thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if this welcome is really sincere,&#8221;
he questioned. &#8220;The newspapers say that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
relations between the two countries are terribly
strained. In America we could not display
this mask of friendship if there was dislike
in our hearts. But the Orientals, if one
may believe the writers on the subject, are different.
An order from their Emperor would be
sufficient to freeze a smile on everyone&#8217;s face;&mdash;a
perpetual smile, made for the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen and Winston were now
fully dressed in their most official uniform,
and were patiently waiting the summons to
join their captain.</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers, in command of the United
States cruiser &#8220;Alaska,&#8221; had arrived with his
ship in Japan at the time of the annual garden
f&ecirc;te, given at the height of bloom of the
chrysanthemum, the sacred flower of Japan.
It had been rumored that this was not the reason
of the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; visit; but certain it was
that His Majesty had immediately sent them
out invitations for the royal f&ecirc;te, provided a
special train, rooms at the Imperial Hotel, put
carriages always at their disposal, and caused
to be prepared an elaborate program of entertainment,&mdash;all
for his unexpected American
naval visitors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>All Tokyo was in gala dress. Everywhere
the chrysanthemum was displayed, of all sizes
and all colors. The holiday crowd was in
good humor, and as the carriages of the naval
men, in all their gold lace, drove rapidly along,
they were greeted on all sides with welcoming
&#8220;banzais&#8221; from hundreds of throats.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing belligerent in this welcome,&#8221;
Lieutenant Winston exclaimed, as he
waved gallantly to the smiling faces below him.</p>

<p>They were soon approaching the residence of
the ambassador; farther up the street the
bridge, across which lay the sacred grounds of
the Emperor&#8217;s palace, came into view. The
crowd here became more dense, and the carriages
slowed to a snail&#8217;s pace. The familiar
uniform of the American sailors was seen,
dotted here and there among the crowd.
Some were in rikishas, while others were on
foot; but all were thoroughly enjoying the
novel spectacle.</p>

<p>The ambassador&#8217;s carriage met the naval
officers in front of his own gate and led the
way toward the stone bridge. Many policemen
were lined up on each side of the
thoroughfare, intent upon keeping the roadway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
clear for the numerous state carriages.
The little jinrikishas darted here and there
between the carriages, making the onlooker
almost fearful for the life of their occupants.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were in New York, the traffic squad
policeman would be on that fellow&#8217;s trail,&#8221;
Sydney Monroe cried out as an automobile
dashed by them.</p>

<p>The three watched the speeding machine
with bated breath. A loud cry from the crowd
and then a hoarse murmur of protest, and the
machine had come to a stop alongside the next
carriage ahead.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s quick eye had seen the whole affair,
and indignantly he jumped to the ground to
see if the sailorman whose jinrikisha had
been so ruthlessly bowled over had received
injuries. The Japanese onlookers, quick to
resent injustice, had formed a solid wall about
the machine, their intention evidently being
not to allow the culprits to escape until the
police had investigated the damages and injuries.</p>

<p>Phil helped the sailor occupant of the overturned
jinrikisha to his feet. He was dazed
but unhurt. One of the man&#8217;s friends had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
excitedly taken the driver of the machine to
task for his recklessness, and the answer was
angry and, Phil thought, almost brutal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It served him jolly well right. What
right have you sailors to block the roadway?&#8221;</p>

<p>A toot of the horn and the crowd melted
away from in front of the machine. There are
few who can stand calmly before an automobile
if its engine is whirring and the loud
screech of its syren bids you to step aside.
But the lad was angry straight through, not
only at the man&#8217;s recklessness, but at his unfeeling
answer to the sailor, and further, there
was something familiar in the man&#8217;s voice.
Phil therefore stood his ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, I&#8217;d like your number,&#8221; he cried
out, raising his hand impetuously to stay the
machine. The car gave a quick leap, and Phil
all but fell to the ground. Then it stopped,
and as Phil recovered himself the picture he
beheld was a very stirring one. The motor
had come to a halt, but not voluntarily; a
sailorman was standing on the step, the clutch
lever held securely back, while the man in the
car had taken off his goggles and was staring
angrily at the bold American.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;How dare you lay hands on me!&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>Jack O&#8217;Neil, boatswain&#8217;s mate in the United
States navy, might not have heard the angry
exclamation, for all the answer he gave. He
was awaiting orders from his superior officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him, sir,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have his number, sir,&#8221; another sailor
volunteered.</p>

<p>Phil waved his hand to O&#8217;Neil; the latter
let go the clutch lever, and slid back into the
gaping crowd, not however without a parting
sally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, mister, remember next time when
you&#8217;re in a hurry not to run over an American;
he is liable to puncture your tire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise of the gears drowned his words,
but from his gleeful chuckle O&#8217;Neil seemed to
have enjoyed his own bit of pleasantry, and
after all that was all that was necessary, for a
foreigner could not be expected to understand
American wit.</p>

<p>The little Japanese police had been hard by,
and doubtless enjoyed the businesslike way in
which O&#8217;Neil handled a delicate situation, but
they were carrying out their orders received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
from no less an authority than the chief of
police&mdash;to hold themselves aloof from the
visiting man-of-war&#8217;s men, and under no circumstances
to make arrests unless for the
sailors&#8217; own safety.</p>

<p>The little incident was all over in a few
moments, and before the occupants of any
other carriage could reach the scene to inquire
into the cause of the disturbance, Phil was
back again in his own carriage, writing
the number given him by the sailor in his
pocket note-book, to be saved for future
reference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not hurt, only jolted a bit,&#8221; was his explanation
to the inquiries of his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice beauty in distress on the
rear seat of the auto?&#8221; Lieutenant Winston&#8217;s
eyes were twinkling. &#8220;There were two of
them, and, by Jove! I envied you standing
there championing the fallen, with their admiring
eyes upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He read the surprise in Phil&#8217;s face. &#8220;What,
didn&#8217;t see them! My! it looked to me as if
you were playing up to the part. I&#8217;ll wager
that the chap driving will have a bad half
hour with them for his recklessness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Phil decided not to announce his suspicions,
for after all he might be mistaken. The man&#8217;s
voice certainly sounded like the one in the
next compartment in the train, but then there
was a great similarity between English voices
to an American ear.</p>

<p>The arrival of the leaders at the gates of
the palace grounds cut short further speculation
upon the incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;On foot from here,&#8221; they were told by
obsequious gentlemen in waiting, and glad to
be able to stretch their limbs after the drive,
the officers alighted, and were conducted
through the Emperor&#8217;s magnificent gardens
to the large pavilion where the f&ecirc;te was to be
held.</p>

<p>For the next half hour the two midshipmen
felt that they were peeping at a scene
from fairy-land. The grace and color of everything
the eye touched upon was pleasing&mdash;the
foliage of the trees, the profusion of flowers,
the delicate perfume impregnating the air.
Silks, satins, and gold lace were on every hand.
Men whose names were household words for
diplomacy and war were where a hand could
be reached out to touch them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;This is as near fame as I&#8217;ll ever get, probably,&#8221;
Sydney whispered as the well-known
features of the prime minister appeared at
his elbow, their coat sleeves touching in the
crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Winston over there,&#8221; Phil returned
in the same spirit of fun. &#8220;That&#8217;s as
near to a naval hero as he&#8217;ll be for some
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So engrossed were the lads in noting the
famous Japanese statesmen and celebrities
of two foreign wars, whose likenesses had become
familiar to them from studies of the
history of this wonderful island kingdom,
that an elderly gentleman had been striving
to speak to them for several moments before
they became aware of his presence.</p>

<p>Turning, both midshipmen grasped eagerly
the outstretched hand of the American ambassador.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have you both here, after all, and I
mean to hold on to you if I must imprison
you to do it,&#8221; the Honorable Henry Tillotson
exclaimed, shaking their hands warmly
and smiling down upon them from his stand
on the grassy embankment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Nothing would suit us better, eh, Syd?&#8221;
Phil cried gladly.</p>

<p>A young girl, dressed all in white, stood
at the ambassador&#8217;s side, but he paid her no
attention, so delighted was he in welcoming
the two lads. She smiled happily upon the
scene, while her gloved hand plucked her
father&#8217;s arm gently to remind him of her
presence.</p>

<p>The passing crowd glanced admiringly at
the group, and especially at the graceful
American girl.</p>

<p>The ambassador was still oblivious of her.
His kindly face beamed with pleasure, and
he was loath to give up the sturdy brown
hands within his own.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden pause, and the smile
on Mr. Tillotson&#8217;s face died suddenly away.
His thoughts had quickly traveled far off to
the Philippine Islands, where he had last
seen these young men beside him. He had
gone there to bring away the body of an only
boy&mdash;a son whom he had loved, but who
had grieved his father&#8217;s heart by his wild and
erratic life. A soldier&#8217;s grave had sealed
within it his boy and all the bitterness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had been in the father&#8217;s breast for him. And
these young men, barely more than boys, had
been important actors in the closing tragedy
of that son&#8217;s life. One of them had led a
forlorn hope in an endeavor to save him from
the Filipino traitor who had taken his life,
and yet there this boy stood&mdash;Philip Perry&mdash;in
the bright sunlight, and he would never
see his son again.</p>

<p>But his boy had been a soldier, and had
died a soldier&#8217;s death. The joy of the present
must not be marred.</p>

<p>The ambassador was being attentively observed
by the young girl at his elbow; she
had seen his keen joy upon greeting these
two striking young American officers, and
then almost immediately had seen the smile
fade and his shoulders perceptibly droop, and
her womanly instinct was at once alert to
help him overcome this burden of sorrow and
dead hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, I shall have to introduce myself,
if you forget your parental duty,&#8221; she whispered
softly in his ear.</p>

<p>This brought the wandering thoughts of the
sorrowing man to the scene before him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>He was again his jovial self. His arm went
out and about the girlish waist and he drew
her gently to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, child, I thought you were with the
Kingsleys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My daughter, Helen,&#8221;
he added proudly.</p>

<p>The midshipmen bowed. Phil felt a deep
blush mount to his face as he took her proffered
fingers. He had expected to see a child,
and here was a grown up young lady. Yet
he assured himself that he was not sorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had known you both for
years,&#8221; she said cordially. &#8220;We came in a
motor,&#8221; she added to her father&#8217;s exclamation.
&#8220;That was how we arrived before you.&#8221; Phil
cast a swift glance of inquiry at her, and the
quick look of understanding in Helen Tillotson&#8217;s
face brought again the blush to his
cheek. She had been one of the two ladies
in the car he had stopped. Then she would
know the name of the man who had run
down the sailor. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go into
the receiving tent with the Kingsleys, when
I can go in with my own countrymen,&#8221; Helen
continued coaxingly to her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must present Captain Rodgers and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
officers, Helen,&#8221; the ambassador returned, his
face anxious. &#8220;I thought you were quite
satisfied with the plan. You are very uncertain,&#8221;
he added in some annoyance. &#8220;You
know how much the Japanese think of etiquette
in these formal affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not go in with Mr. Perry and
me?&#8221; Sydney asked, as he stepped forward
eagerly to the girl&#8217;s side. &#8220;We are not important&mdash;midshipmen
don&#8217;t count for much with
all this rank about.&#8221; Phil smiled broadly on
his companion for so ably saving the situation;
the ambassador appeared greatly relieved,
while Helen gladly accepted the offered
escort.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going in now,&#8221; she exclaimed,
letting go her father&#8217;s arm as a Japanese aide-de-camp
of high naval rank bowed ceremoniously
to the ambassador and offered himself
as their companion to escort them into the
presence of their Majesties.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen experienced that sensation
that every one has felt who has marched
behind a band as they walked slowly between
two lines of Japanese imperial guards, their
rifles held rigidly at the &#8220;present,&#8221; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Emperor&#8217;s band played the impressive national
anthem of Japan. Ahead of them were many
notables; the diplomatic corps in their court
dress, their breasts emblazoned with jeweled
orders and decorations; officers of the army
and navy, and with these were the naval and
military attach&eacute;s from foreign lands. Helen
and her midshipmen followed after the military
and naval men, while behind them came
the court set of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Neither of the lads remembered afterward
much of what happened when they were once
inside of the spacious receiving tent; its walls
hung with flags to represent one great red and
white chrysanthemum, emblematic of both
the flower and the Mikado&#8217;s family crest. To
Phil the Emperor&#8217;s face had been a blur, while
the Empress he could recall only as a slight
figure in black with many sparkling jewels.
It was over in a moment, and the three young
people found themselves strolling together
along one of the beautifully kept garden
paths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it marvelous?&#8221; Helen exclaimed as
she saw the wonder in the lads&#8217; faces. &#8220;The
Japanese are the most artistic people in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
world. Every place they touch turns into a
fairy-land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What strikes me most forcibly,&#8221; Phil replied
enthusiastically, &#8220;is how such matter-of-fact,
serious people as they are can find time
to be so artistic. Now with us in America
we find ourselves too busy keeping up with
the progress of the day to indulge in art and
beauty. We leave that to those who have
nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Helen said sorrowfully, &#8220;and
more&#8217;s the pity. We are so prosaic in America;
while here even the poorest artisan has
the magic gift of beautifying what he creates.
A thing that displeases the eye, never mind
how strongly it is made, is a failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all this fuss is being made over the
blooming of a flower,&#8221; Sydney said questioningly.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any such f&ecirc;te in our
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you don&#8217;t know your own country,&#8221;
Helen replied banteringly. &#8220;In California
they have the flower battles when the roses
are in full bloom, and they crown a king and
queen, while in New Orleans they have the
winter carnival. Both ideas are very similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to the flower f&ecirc;tes in Japan, only here there
is no necessity to crown a king.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped before a number of large
plants which appeared covered with flowers;
the stalk of each had been secured to a stick
stuck in the ground to support its burden of
blossoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the highest chrysanthemum cultivation,&#8221;
Helen said, indicating the bush;
&#8220;you may count sometimes one thousand
flowers on a single plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads looked disappointedly at the tiny
blossoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t look like the chrysanthemums
we know,&#8221; Phil said. &#8220;They are so small.
Ours are big and massive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So were these before the Japanese began
the cultivation,&#8221; the girl returned. &#8220;They
consider our flowers crude and ugly. The
highest art is accomplished when one small
plant is grown to give many hundred blossoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil strived to appear interested in the cultivation
of Japan&#8217;s national flower, but his
thoughts were mostly upon the identity of
the man in the next compartment on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
train from Tokyo. He was on the point of
inquiring from Helen Tillotson the name of
the driver of the machine she had come in,
but he decided that it would be more seemly
if she first said something about the accident.
The lad had not long to wait, for as they
turned about Sydney left them and he found
himself alone with the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were splendid this afternoon,&#8221; she
said enthusiastically. &#8220;I was so glad to see
Mr. Impey taken to task for his reckless
driving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea you were in the machine,&#8221;
Phil returned, highly pleased at her friendliness.
&#8220;I hope you weren&#8217;t annoyed at being
held there before such a crowd. I saw it
happen and my anger got the better of me.
I really didn&#8217;t intend to be theatrical,&#8221; he
added, blushing fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t a bit,&#8221; Helen hastened to
assure him, &#8220;but I was so incensed at Mr.
Impey&#8217;s retort to the anxious sailor, who was
only giving him some well-meant advice, that
I have refused to ride back with the Kingsleys
in his car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sailor was not hurt,&#8221; Phil said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
thoughtfully, &#8220;and I hope I haven&#8217;t made
one of your friends my enemy. He is here,
I suppose?&#8221; he asked, his pulse beating
quicker as he remembered the similarity in
voice to the man on the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall see him before long,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;He goes everywhere, and knows
every one in Tokyo worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to a crossway in the path;
the conversation had died out from lack of a
topic. Phil contemplated the regular profile
of the girl beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will turn here,&#8221; she said, indicating
the path to the left, &#8220;and go to the refreshment
tent. That&#8217;s where we shall find all
our friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no hurry to return,&#8221; he exclaimed,
stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how anxious you are to
return until you meet all the dainty little
Japanese maidens waiting to serve you with
all sorts of nice things to eat and drink,&#8221; she
said smiling. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; she added archly,
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t met all our officers from the
&#8216;Alaska.&#8217; I know, of course, that Mr. Philip
Perry is a host in himself, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;I am sorry you think me so selfish and
self-centred,&#8221; he interrupted, much confused.
&#8220;You are so different from what I expected,&#8221;
he blurted out. &#8220;I thought you were only a
little girl. Won&#8217;t you forgive me for sending
you all those senseless messages in my letters
to your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen bit her lips. &#8220;Oh, it was very nice
of you to send them,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind introducing me to Mr.
Impey?&#8221; Phil asked, bravely changing the
subject and speaking the wish uppermost in
his mind. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to apologize for my
rudeness to him. I did not know, until
Lieutenant Winston told me, that ladies were
in the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>While talking they had approached the
refreshment tent, and Helen was at once
surrounded by Phil&#8217;s messmates from the
&#8220;Alaska,&#8221; all anxious for an introduction.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen soon found themselves
on the outskirts of the crowd. Helen
had promised the introduction to Mr. Impey
if Phil would only locate him, so the two
companions drifted along on the lookout for
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;I have an idea, Syd,&#8221; Phil whispered,
&#8220;that this Mr. Impey of the automobile is
the conspirator I overheard on the train.
Here&#8217;s a chance for some nice work to run
him to earth if he is. A voice is a dangerous
identification to pin much faith upon, but
people have been betrayed by that means in
lots of criminal cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put too much confidence in such
an airy clue,&#8221; Sydney replied; &#8220;but it&#8217;s worth
investigation, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving Sydney with Captain Rodgers,
Phil strolled slowly away on his quest for the
owner of the automobile. The crowd about
him was dense, and he soon saw the hopelessness
of locating even a familiar face in such
a throng. Dazed by the crowd and still
speculating upon Impey&#8217;s identity, his eyes
were on the gravel path. Suddenly a Japanese
lieutenant barred his way. The lad
politely stepped aside for him to pass.</p>

<p>Then he was aware that this naval man
had prodded him in the ribs. A flush of
annoyance came into his face. It was not
pleasant to have one&#8217;s thoughts so rudely interrupted.
He raised his eyes and gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
blankly at a Japanese officer standing directly
in his path and laughing heartily up at him.
Phil was conscious of even white teeth and a
deep black moustache. No spark of recognition
came to him as he once more stepped
aside, murmuring an apology for his awkwardness.
But the obstacle still was in front of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry! how are you, Perry!&#8221; The naval
officer&#8217;s English, with scarce an accent, opened
the flood-gates of memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the luck,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
heartily, the annoyance of a moment since
dying in his face as he seized the outstretched
hand of his former classmate at the Naval
Academy at Annapolis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki, you young heathen,&#8221; he cried, hugging
the young Japanese boyishly.</p>

<p>Mutakito Takishima was laughing joyously,
and in turn wringing Phil&#8217;s hand and slapping
him over the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad to see you, Perry,&#8221; Takishima
cried again, renewing his demonstrations
of affection.</p>

<p>This meeting of two old friends and their
evident joy at seeing each other again caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the curious ones to stop, and the little Japanese
saw that very soon the walk would become
crowded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come with me, Perry?&#8221; he asked,
and Phil, accepting readily, marched away
arm in arm with his classmate.</p>

<p>They made their way to one of the many
tents spread on the velvety grass of the
garden. Phil gazed in admiration at the
wonderful construction of these frail out-of-door
houses. The material was of many
delicate tints, and all bedecked with flags.
The floors were covered with costly rugs,
while polished tables and upholstered chairs
were strewn about in profusion, the tables
well covered with refreshments.</p>

<p>As they entered several dainty little Japanese
girls came running up with their quaint
shuffling gait, and bowed low, uttering polite
words of welcome in their own language.</p>

<p>Takishima clicked his heels together and
bowed almost to the ground before these
sparkling-eyed little ladies, dressed in exquisitely
embroidered silk and satin kimonos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Kamikura and my sister, Hama-san,&#8221;
Takishima said, smiling with keen enjoyment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
at Phil&#8217;s evident pleasure. Phil bowed and
shook hands in American fashion with the
two bright-faced Japanese girls. He recognized
the name of one to be the same as an
illustrious admiral.</p>

<p>&#8220;My chief&#8217;s daughter,&#8221; Takishima added,
in a low tone to Phil, while the young ladies
with their own hands brought refreshments
from the heaping tables. &#8220;They are ladies
of the household, assisting our Empress at
the garden f&ecirc;te.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed with renewed interest at these
doll-like beauties, wishing to speak, yet believing
that surely neither could understood
English.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are they?&#8221; he thought&mdash;&#8220;surely
not beyond sixteen years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima had been talking to the young
ladies in his own soft language, while Phil
studied their enthusiastic faces. He knew
that he was the subject of the conversation,
and felt very conscious until Hama-san
changed this feeling to one of delighted surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are one of my brother&#8217;s schoolmates,&#8221;
Takishima&#8217;s sister, Hama-san, exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
again bowing gracefully to Phil. The
midshipman was startled to hear one of these
delicate dolls speak his own difficult language,
and the surprise in his face caused all three
of his companions to laugh gayly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak English!&#8221; he gasped, and then
joined in the laugh on himself. &#8220;How stupid
of me,&#8221; he added hastily. &#8220;O Hama-san was
at Vassar while Taki was at Annapolis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you speak English too?&#8221; he asked of
Miss Kamikura.</p>

<p>Cho Kamikura, or O Chio-san, as she was
called by her friends, shook her head, smiling
nevertheless into the lad&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Phil almost dropped the plate from which
he was eating, as he suddenly saw his sought
for Mr. Impey enter the tent and come
directly toward his party. Takishima grasped
his hand cordially, while his woman companion
stopped to speak with Phil&#8217;s new-found
girl friends. Then, his pulse beating fast, he
felt Takishima&#8217;s hand on his arm, and he
turned about to encounter the not too friendly
eyes of Impey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, let me introduce you to Mr. Impey.
He is a great friend of His Excellency, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
American ambassador,&#8221; and then the ceremonious
Japanese officer introduced Phil to
Mrs. Kingsley and then to Mr. Kingsley, who
had lagged behind his wife.</p>

<p>This was the automobile party with whom
Helen Tillotson had come to the garden f&ecirc;te,
and who on their way had run down the
sailor&#8217;s rikisha. Phil glanced covertly at
Impey as he bowed over the hands of the two
Japanese young ladies. &#8220;A friend of his ambassador
and, of course, of Helen,&#8221; he thought;
&#8220;then he could hardly be the same man who
had insisted in the railway coach that America
was intentionally misleading Japan, and would
eventually force a war upon her to wrest from
her the fruits of her victory over Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Mr. Perry,&#8221; Mr. Impey exclaimed
loudly as he returned to Phil&#8217;s side, &#8220;it was
very stupid of me to run down one of your
sailors. I was most awfully glad to find he
was unhurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thanked him quietly, but without
enthusiasm. He felt that his sympathy was
not genuine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You championed him beautifully,&#8221; Impey
added, smiling patronizingly. &#8220;The ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
with me were much impressed, and showed
me their displeasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil blushed deeply. The apology that he
had determined upon stuck in his throat.
He decided now it was unnecessary. There
was a vague, intangible something in the man&#8217;s
voice which made Phil suspicious that Impey
was not what he would like to appear. What
it was Phil was at a loss to describe, but he
resolved that he would give his best efforts to
discovering it, and hoped that his judgment
had not misled him. He now believed that
Impey and the man in the next compartment
on the train were one and the same person.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>WAR TALK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had only just finished the cooling refreshments
so daintily served them, when
the American party, led by one of Japan&#8217;s
most illustrious admirals, entered the tent.
Lieutenant Takishima was on his feet in an
instant, his heels firmly together, and his
hand raised to his cap vizor. Phil followed
the little Japanese&#8217;s example, and grasped
the naval hero&#8217;s hand warmly as the latter
stepped over to greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admiral Kamikura is my chief; he is our
Minister of Marine,&#8221; Takishima whispered as
the high ranking naval officer returned to
Captain Rodgers&#8217; side. &#8220;It was he who commanded
the cruiser squadron during our late
war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded: his eyes were devouring admiringly
and with a great deal of reverence
the short well-built naval officer. He marveled
at the youthful appearance of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
admiral; Captain Rodgers looked years older.
He turned questioning eyes upon his foreign
classmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very young for an admiral?&#8221;
There was mystification in his voice.</p>

<p>Takishima shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;About forty-five,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;He has
been an admiral two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil sighed thoughtfully. He was thinking
of the difference between the two navies.
Captain Rodgers, he knew, had passed his
fifty-fifth birthday, and was no nearer than
three years to his rear admiral&#8217;s commission.</p>

<p>The Kingsleys had left Mr. Impey with
his new-found friends, and had joined Miss
Tillotson and the newcomers. As if by
mutual consent Takishima and his party had
withdrawn to a small table farthest from the
refreshment booth where Sydney had enthusiastically
pounced upon the Japanese lieutenant,
and the two were demonstrative over this
unlooked-for meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than two years ago, Taki, you were
only a midshipman, and now you have two
gold stripes on your sleeve!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
in wonder. &#8220;That&#8217;s promotion for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a high compliment to your academy
at Annapolis,&#8221; Takishima replied, smiling
blandly. &#8220;You and Perry would now be
lieutenants if you were in our navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that would be impossible,&#8221; Phil
laughed gayly. &#8220;Imagine our giving orders
to your sailors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember how you tacked ship
in the &#8216;Severn&#8217; on the practice cruise?&#8221;
Sydney asked reminiscently, his happy face
all smiles at the recollection. &#8220;You were
so rattled you had forgotten your English,
but you sang out your orders in Japanese at
the right time and she went about beautifully.
You knew the time, but didn&#8217;t remember the
words, eh, Taki?&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima was not the slightest bit hurt
at this playful jibe. His answer showed that
only too plainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember Lieutenant-Commander
Hesler?&#8221; he exclaimed happily. &#8220;Well, I
tried to imitate the sound of his orders and
I don&#8217;t know what I said. I think most of
it was Japanese, but I was not so frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
that I forgot when the orders should be
given.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anything of the war?&#8221; Phil
asked the question suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the big battle with Admiral
Kamikura; on his staff,&#8221; Takishima answered
proudly.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen gazed with envious
eyes at their classmate. They now regarded
him in a different light. He was no longer
the unassuming little midshipman they had
known at the naval academy; inoffensive,
good natured, ever willing to play a practical
joke and never hurt when one was played
upon him. This diminutive youngster, probably
a year younger than they, had taken part
in, seen with his own eyes, the greatest
modern naval engagement of the century.
He had seen great battle-ships in action, had
experienced the horror of high explosive
shells bursting near him. He had seen many
men killed and battle-ships sink beneath the
seas, carrying their doomed crews with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one point on which you were
touchy, Taki, and I could never understand
why,&#8221; Sydney said, and immediately looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
as if he would have liked to withdraw the
question, for he saw a cloud of annoyance
pass over Takishima&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;At being called a &#8216;Jap&#8217;?&#8221; Takishima
asked. His face was quite sober as he made
his inquiry, and received Sydney&#8217;s nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like me to call you a Yankee?&#8221;
The question was asked almost fiercely.
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t like being called a
Jap. I don&#8217;t know why, and neither do you,
but you see we both object to the words being
used to us by people of another race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to remember, Taki,&#8221; Sydney
agreed in conciliation, &#8220;but we Americans
are so prone to abbreviate everything. We
don&#8217;t mean to belittle you when we speak of
your people as &#8216;Japs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Impey, although silent, had not missed
a word. He was carefully studying the characters
of this little scene. How might he use
them in the plans that he had been carefully
formulating in his scheming brain? Trained
to diplomacy, he quickly perceived the relationship
existing between these naval men.
Their training had been along parallel lines,
but one had gone back to his own people and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
had been entrusted with duties high above the
grasp of his classmates in naval school days.
The Americans impressed Impey as irresponsible
boys, while the young Japanese seemed
deeper, more thoughtful and calculating.
Impey could see that each in time of peril
would not shirk danger; but the Americans
would be rash, while the Japanese lieutenant
would be cautious and calculating.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; Takishima asked quickly, to
change the subject; &#8220;you have seen service?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads nodded their heads, while Phil
answered in an apologetic voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Philippines, in China and South
America, but nothing like your experiences.
You must tell us about it some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much to tell,&#8221; Takishima replied
truthfully. &#8220;I was very much frightened
at first, but afterward I became so excited
I forgot my fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I don&#8217;t remember a thing that happened,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;I tried to afterward
when the admiral directed me to write a report.
All I could say was we opened fire at
the enemy and they fired back at us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Sydney and Phil both laughed at Takishima&#8217;s
droll way of putting things.</p>

<p>Suddenly Takishima rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me disturb you,&#8221; he begged politely.
&#8220;My admiral, on whose staff I am,
has already gone, so I must follow.&#8221; He
shook hands affectionately with his classmates.
&#8220;I am sure you and Mr. Impey will
have plenty to talk about,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Mr.
Impey is very much interested in war-ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil believed he detected that Impey started
imperceptibly at Takishima&#8217;s words; but
nothing he had said seemed to Phil to be of
significance. He welcomed an opportunity to
talk with this man and perhaps surprise him
into that which would betray him. They
watched Takishima walk briskly away, his
small dirk, the Samurai emblem of honor,
jingling at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice chap that,&#8221; Impey said quietly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the Minister of Marine&#8217;s right hand
aide.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had all risen to bid Takishima good-bye,
and now found themselves once more on
the gravel walk of the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; Impey exclaimed as he led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
way. &#8220;It&#8217;s not often we barbarians get a
glimpse within the royal enclosure, so we
must make the most of it while we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Impey knew when to be silent.
While the midshipmen were conversing with
their classmate he had listened discreetly; but
now he displayed the conversational art which
had lifted him from an humble accountant in
a Chinese bank to a position of wealth and
influence. What his position was Phil and
Sydney as yet had no knowledge.</p>

<p>He described to them the objects of artistic
interest about them, and after a quarter of an
hour&#8217;s intimate talk even Phil had almost
changed his mind and felt that such a delightful
personage could hardly be a two-faced
rogue.</p>

<p>They had exhausted the beauties of nature
but were still strolling through the gardens
when a group of Japanese army and naval officers
came suddenly around a turn in the
path. The midshipmen&#8217;s eyes noted their
erect carriages, their breasts covered with
medals, commemorating deeds of valor accomplished
in two wars. The Americans
saluted, and their brothers in service stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
aside politely, bowing low in their own fashion.
Impey doffed his silk hat, and greeted
one of their number by name, advancing to
take his outstretched hand. In a second the
group had passed onward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Captain Inaba, one of the brightest
men in the Japanese navy,&#8221; he added as
he joined the midshipmen, who had strolled
ahead slowly during the short interruption.
&#8220;He is the man your navy will have to be
careful of in case of war. I dare say he has
fought it all out and could tell you just where
the battles will be and who will win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk as if war were an accomplished
fact,&#8221; Phil blurted out; the idea of the identity
of Impey with the &#8220;man in the next
compartment&#8221; was again strong in his mind.
&#8220;I see no reason why my country and Japan
should go to war. Certainly we don&#8217;t want a
war with anybody, least of all Japan, whom
we have helped to become one of the great
world powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>An expression of cunning came into Impey&#8217;s
face, which was unseen by the two lads,
while he began to explain earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Japan is an enigma to you Western men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Her diplomats have not a selfish drop of
blood in their bodies. Every thought is for
the empire. At this very moment the history
of Japan for the next twenty years has
been tentatively written by men like Captain
Inaba, whom we have just passed. Every
step has probably been considered and solved
by their tacticians. Is war with America
then such an impossibility?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;War with my country would be more of
an impossibility than it is,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
angrily, &#8220;if those who are intriguing behind
her back would only come out in the open to
do their talking.&#8221; He glared fixedly at
Impey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own countrymen at home are doing
most of the harm,&#8221; Impey replied with an expressive
shrug. &#8220;Your labor party is alienating
what good feeling Japan has had for
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That has been adjusted,&#8221; Sydney said, up
to now content only to listen, &#8220;and the immigration
question has been made a national
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the friction stirred up by the
labor unions on the Pacific coast between your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
countrymen and Japanese immigrants has
been echoed in every part of Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are those here in Japan of
neither nationality who take great pleasure in
fanning the blaze of misunderstanding,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed pointedly; but Impey appeared
perfectly serene under this direct insinuation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that our newspapers have often
harped on a probable war with Japan,&#8221; Phil
continued more quietly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;
To the youngster it seemed almost ungentlemanly
to talk so belligerently while they were
the guests of the Japanese nation. &#8220;The
United States have a very much larger fleet
than Japan can maintain, and besides, she
knows that if a war should occur Japan must
provoke it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your country has been at peace for over
fifty years,&#8221; Impey replied, &#8220;for the war with
Spain was too insignificant to count, and a
wise man once said that &#8216;a war every fifty
years was an excellent tonic for a nation, if it
wished to avoid becoming commercial and
effeminate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our nation will not provoke war,&#8221; Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
insisted. &#8220;There&#8217;d be no object in it. Japan
is too far away for us to quarrel with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you believe that nothing would induce
the United States to go to war with
Japan?&#8221; Impey asked. &#8220;Even if Japan
should suddenly buy China&#8217;s new navy, for
instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen gasped in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; they both asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On its way from Europe to China,&#8221;
Impey returned, smiling blandly, &#8220;with
Chinese crews and in command of Admiral
Ting. You see you are not too well up on
what is going on in the world,&#8221; he added
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the reason of the presence
of your fleet in Manila Bay?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Phil replied quickly. &#8220;It
came out on a practice cruise and will return
within a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey shrugged his shoulders, a knowing
smile on his face that angered Phil greatly.
&#8220;If Japan means to buy these ships&mdash;then
look out; for if she does&mdash;it means war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further talk on this dangerous topic was
cut short by the discovery that the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
party had driven away. The midshipmen
were much chagrined to find that no carriage
had been left behind for them. The Kingsleys
had left a note for Mr. Impey saying
that they had gone on with the ambassador
and the American officers to the embassy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me in the machine. I can set
you down anywhere you say,&#8221; Impey suggested
as he cranked up his waiting machine.
&#8220;From this note I fear I am not
included in your ambassador&#8217;s invitation,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>Phil hesitated; he was still angry at himself
for allowing Impey to discuss with him
the relations between America and Japan.
He felt that it were better to have nothing to
do with this man, who was apparently leading
a dual life in Tokyo&mdash;one minute advising
a Japanese nobleman that America was
insincere, and the next, assuring the Americans
that Japan was unfriendly.</p>

<p>Sydney appeared to have no feeling in the
matter, for he was already in the rear seat.
Phil followed, the consoling thought in his
mind that Impey might bear careful watching
too and that this was the best way to do it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Impey threw in the clutch, and the machine
glided along the macadam roadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the American Embassy, I suppose?&#8221; he
questioned over his shoulder as they turned
into a narrower street. The speed did not
slacken, but the horn was being sounded in
warning to the startled holiday crowds that
filled the street ahead of them.</p>

<p>Phil managed to answer in the affirmative,
but his voice was lost in the wail of the
syren.</p>

<p>The crowd ahead had quickly cleared the
road, while Impey, seeing the way clear, was
soon tearing at full speed down the street.
The official buildings of the empire flashed
past on either hand.</p>

<p>Opposite the navy building a great crowd
had collected to do honor to one of Japan&#8217;s
naval heroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better slow up?&#8221; Sydney asked
apprehensively, as he realized the density of
the crowd, but the driver of the machine
gave no heed to the anxious voice behind
him. The masterful way in which he guided
the great car in and out among carriages,
rikishas and pedestrians won the admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of the midshipmen in spite of their dread of
an accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly can handle her,&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
&#8220;but it raises my hair to see the
close shaves he makes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just ahead a figure in uniform was running
at the side of the roadway. It was plain that
he was an official messenger, and carrying
government despatches.</p>

<p>Phil gave a warning shout. It seemed to
the lad that the machine was bearing down
directly upon him&mdash;too dangerously close for
comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he sheer off?&#8221; Phil gasped.
&#8220;That man must be deaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything happened so quickly that no
appreciable time had elapsed between the
sighting of the messenger ahead and the
sudden stop made by the car just as the man
tried to cross in front of it.</p>

<p>Tingling with nervousness, the midshipmen
had cried out repeatedly at Impey&#8217;s recklessness,
but he turned a deaf ear. The pedestrians
could all be depended upon to jump
away at the first sound of the horn. Impey
doubtless thought the messenger ahead would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
do the same; but unfortunately for his calculations
the man was stone deaf, a pensioned
sailor, whose hearing had been ruined in an
explosion on shipboard. As the car approached,
he was first conscious of its presence,
but not its direction, from the information
received in the faces of people about
him. He suddenly stopped in his tracks
bewildered. Even now all would have been
well had he not done just the one thing that
could lead to disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop her!&#8221; both lads cried in horror, but
even then they realized it was too late.</p>

<p>With faces blanched with terror the three
men sat rooted to their seats. They had seen
the poor man fall directly in front of the
speeding machine in a wild attempt to save
himself from an unknown danger.</p>

<p>A cry had risen from the hundreds of bystanders.
It held an ill-omened note of menace.
The faces were no longer smiling, but
wore a look of horror and righteous anger.
The machine was completely surrounded.
Phil would have leaped from the car to help
the injured man, but he was met with open
opposition and was forced back into his seat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Aghast, the midshipmen saw Impey in the
grasp of nearly a dozen threatening Japanese.
His hands still clutched the steering wheel,
and in a second his perfectly-fitting frock-coat
was torn from his body. His face was white
with fear, and his eyes, turned toward them,
had a dumb animal appeal. To be hauled
from his seat meant instant death at the
hands of the outraged mob.</p>

<p>The car was given a sudden lurch by the
efforts of several score of men who had lifted
the forward end from the ground. With a
shudder of horror they saw the form of the
injured one carried away from under the
cruel wheels.</p>

<p>Impey yet clutched his steering wheel and
fought off the mob with a strength born of
desperation. The two lads were upon their
feet, expecting any moment to find themselves
attacked by the Japanese, for a mob
has no reasoning power, and with it the uniform
of an American naval officer would have
no significance.</p>

<p>However, there was no time to speculate
upon their own dangerous position. Impey&#8217;s
peril was imminently before their startled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
eyes. He must be saved, even if in the attempt
they drew down the wrath of the mob
upon their own heads. They could not see
him dragged to death without making an
effort in his defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me,&#8221; Impey cried piteously.</p>

<p>The appeal was not unanswered. The two
midshipmen cleared the front seat in a bound,
and laid firm hands upon the trembling body
of the terrified man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him tight, Phil,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
as he threw himself upon those who were
attempting to drag Impey from his seat.
Sydney&#8217;s face was determined, only no anger
was displayed, and he relied alone upon his
strength to break the holds of the mob. The
surprised Japanese gave way. They saw the
lad&#8217;s uniform and the authoritative manner
of his movements, not as an enemy but rather
as a peacemaker. They withdrew before him,
and waited as if making up their minds what
to do.</p>

<p>A European, past middle age, suddenly
pushed his way to Sydney&#8217;s side, just as he
had stooped to pick up a long white envelope
which had caught his eye as it lay on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
ground nearly under the fore wheels of the
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mine,&#8221; the newcomer exclaimed
eagerly, snatching it from Sydney&#8217;s hand and
thrusting it into his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you, Mr. Impey?&#8221; he asked
deferentially. Impey drew him into the car
beside him, and then almost collapsed in his
arms. Sydney still held the crowd at bay,
when he was startled to see it of a sudden
surge toward him. A fear came into his
heart as he thought of how it would appear
for him in uniform to be fighting a Japanese
mob. Phil from his position of vantage had
understood the movement, and jumped to the
ground by his friend&#8217;s side just as the crowd
parted and two American sailors shot through,
bringing up almost in the arms of the midshipmen.</p>

<small>STIRRING UP TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I&#8217;d</span> like to have seen the garden f&ecirc;te.&#8221;
The speaker arose from his seat at a desk,
pushed a mass of papers aside and glanced at
his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, it&#8217;s nearly over,&#8221; he added in
some surprise. He put his watch back in his
pocket, and took a coat and hat from a peg in
the corner. &#8220;There&#8217;s my stuff on the desk.
I am ashamed to be the author of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim, I think I&#8217;ll go around and take a
look at these naval officers I&#8217;ve been maligning.
They&#8217;ll be coming away from the party
just about the time I get there, and I&#8217;ve a
card of admission here in my pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! this is your coat. Why on earth
don&#8217;t you have the lining sewed up? You&#8217;ll
be losing something out of it before long if
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Randall, newspaper correspondent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
hung up the other&#8217;s coat and took his own,
putting it on thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim, you haven&#8217;t any business sticking to
such an uncertain game as this,&#8221; he added, a
note of sympathy in his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;ve a
family, and ought to be home earning honest
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man addressed, probably twenty years
older than the speaker, laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was attracted by the price, the same as
you were, George,&#8221; he replied regretfully.
&#8220;Neither of us understood what would be
expected of us, and if we weren&#8217;t so hard up
we wouldn&#8217;t have accepted. But we are in it
now, and there&#8217;s no turning back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one of these mornings,&#8221; Randall
said gravely, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to wake up to find
we&#8217;ve been caught, and I&#8217;d hate to think what
the Japs will do to us. Boil us in oil, probably.
That used to be the favorite punishment
for high treason in the days of the late
Shoguns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am frightened at Impey&#8217;s methods,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;He&#8217;s playing a dangerous game, and
now with this American cruiser in port he&#8217;ll
have to be doubly careful.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Well, as long as he keeps that turbine
yacht in Yokohama harbor my mind will be
easy,&#8221; James Wells exclaimed, smiling at his
companion&#8217;s earnestness. &#8220;The Japs don&#8217;t
know that she has the speed of a torpedo
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall&#8217;s hand was on the door-knob, but
suddenly he seemed to change his mind, and
walked back to where his companion was
standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a cur, writing the things I do
when I know they are all untrue.&#8221; His voice
was vehement and his young face wore a
troubled look. &#8220;There&#8217;s only a filmy web
of truth for all the woof of falsehood. If I
were not so completely up against it, I&#8217;d
chuck the whole business and go back home.&#8221;</p>

<p>James Wells&#8217; face hardened slightly, and
he bit his lips to suppress an emotion which
the younger man&#8217;s words caused him to feel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look what we&#8217;ve been doing here for the
last year, nearly,&#8221; Randall continued savagely.
&#8220;Arousing these slow minded Japanese to believe
that the United States is sitting up nights
figuring out how to rob her of her spoils from
Russia. Everything that has come up we&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
turned to our ends. Those San Francisco
immigrant cases we twisted about so that the
Japanese believed that their people were being
hung from the lamp-posts. Now we are trying
to dispose of the Chinese battle-ships to the
country that&#8217;s silly enough to buy them.
We&#8217;ve made the Japanese believe that the
American fleet is only waiting to seize them
before coming north from Manila and putting
Japan entirely out of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;The surprise to me is,&#8221; he added gravely,
&#8220;that men like Captain Inaba and the Emperor&#8217;s
ministers believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you hear a thing every day, served
up to you with all kinds of fancy dressing,
by and by you begin to believe there must
be something to it,&#8221; Wells answered with a
smile. &#8220;Your eloquence, George, is so wonderful
that sometimes, &#8217;pon my soul, I believe it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall smiled grimly at the implied compliment
to his pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a low underhand game we are playing,&#8221;
Randall exclaimed. &#8220;We are nice
Americans to be doing such work. I&#8217;d like
to see that yellow sheet, the &#8216;Shimbunshi,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
suppressed; then you and I would be out of
a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and ten thousand a year,&#8221; Wells
answered; &#8220;that&#8217;s more than we&#8217;ll ever make
again; and most of mine is going to a bank
at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was on to Impey&#8217;s real game,&#8221; he
said thoughtfully. &#8220;He knows all the big
men here. He goes up to see the Chinese
ambassador and dines with him informally.
He just came back from Peking the other day
and let drop a remark to me in a thoughtless
way that told me that he knew Lord Li, and
Chang-Shi-Tung well. He learned Chinese
from one of the big men there who has a seat
on the Wai-Wu-Pu, the privy council to the
throne of China. There&#8217;s more in it than
just selling battle-ships, I&#8217;ll make a bet on
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall shook himself very much as a big
dog would after coming out of the water, as
he exclaimed feelingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there&#8217;s more in it. Impey&#8217;s stirring
up a war between our country and Japan,
and what attracts me is the risk we run.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
It&#8217;s stimulating to know that if we&#8217;re ever
caught a Japanese prison and rice three times
a day will be our reward. And then you see,
Jim, if we can bring on this war, we&#8217;re right
on the ground for war correspondents. That&#8217;s
an inducement for even an old shell-back
newspaper man like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world owes each of us a living, I suppose,&#8221;
Wells answered sadly. &#8220;The more
risks, the better pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up Randall&#8217;s &#8220;copy&#8221; from his
desk and glanced carelessly over it. Then a
spark of interest showed in his sombre face,
almost immediately supplanted by oblivious
concentration. Randall gave an impatient
shrug and, seeing that his friend would be absorbed
for quite half an hour, he threw himself
in a chair to wait patiently until the reading
was over.</p>

<p>The minutes ticked away on the big clock
opposite him, and he drummed nervously
with his finger nails on the arm of his chair.
His glance roamed from his companion and
back to the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Impey I&#8217;d go to the garden f&ecirc;te.&#8221;
His voice was in a half aside. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
how he worked it to get me an invitation.&#8221;
He took it from his pocket and glanced at the
big black Japanese letters with the golden
chrysanthemum at the top. &#8220;I suppose it
reads, &#8216;His Majesty the Emperor of Japan
requests the extreme pleasure of Mr. George
Randall&#8217;s company to a garden f&ecirc;te to meet
Her Majesty the Empress.&#8217; I hope the dear
lady was not greatly disappointed when I
didn&#8217;t appear.&#8221; His face broke into a happy
smile at the ridiculousness of his thoughts.
&#8220;With all the viscounts and barons, to say
nothing of counts and sirs, I hope it was
really a relief to Her Majesty to find I had
not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if I should write her and explain
there was no offense, but that I became
so absorbed in something I was doing, to put
it plainly, to make trouble for her government,
that I quite forgot the time of day.
But I am sure Impey made up for my absence.
That fellow is a wizard, the way he
pulls the wool over people&#8217;s eyes. He&#8217;s as
thick as fleas with the American ambassador&mdash;and,
by Jove!&#8221; Randall stopped his
spoken introspection to whistle softly, &#8220;even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
the ambassador&#8217;s daughter has been taken in.
He has a picturesque part in this show. I
believe I&#8217;d like to take his end. I am not
allowed to see; I only write from notes furnished
me, like a blind novelist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all that rot you&#8217;re talking?&#8221; Wells
had finished his reading and was regarding
Randall, a half smile of amusement on his
earnest face. &#8220;Do you know, George, you
ought to be doing something worth while.
This thing,&#8221; tapping the manuscript he was
reading, &#8220;is a gem. How can you do it? The
&#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; will make a big hit in its morning
edition, and just at the time when Japan
is entertaining our officers. To-morrow the
American captain is to lunch with His Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall heaved a sigh and rose from his
chair. &#8220;Jim, if I could get out of this thing
honorably, I&#8217;d do it to-day, but I can&#8217;t go
back to that little old town in Indiana without
money. They&#8217;ve got me here solid.
Good-bye, Jim; I am going down the street
and talk to some of those clean looking
American sailors I saw this morning. I am
just hungry to hear them talk. You&#8217;re such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
an old musty bookworm that you don&#8217;t know
what it is to pine for the latest slang from little
old New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>After his companion had gone, James
Wells sat silent at his desk. His mind was
reviewing the last few years of his life, conjured
out of the almost forgotten past by
Randall&#8217;s boyish outburst.</p>

<p>Little by little his friend was making him
see their calling through younger eyes. He
was himself an old newspaper man. All
news to him was merchandise to sell to the
highest bidder. To highly color it, to make
it more readable, was part of the game. No
idea of being a traitor to his country or a spy
had ever entered his even, methodical, sober
thoughts until this youngster had sowed the
insidious seeds. Was he really harming his
country? He had never thought of it in that
light. Every country was advancing in military
and naval development and he had been
put at the head of the Tokyo office of a newspaper
syndicate whose avowed purpose was to
collect all manner of news affecting the
armaments and also the political relations between
countries. If he thought that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
syndicate had for its aim to strain the relations
to the breaking point of two naturally
friendly countries, one of which he still considered
his own, why then he would quit, and
go back to a minor position on a big New
York paper which he knew would always be
open for him. He had not always been shown
the effusions of Randall. His work was to
systematically arrange the information received
so that Impey and Randall could use
it. He picked up George&#8217;s manuscript and
let his eyes wander slowly over the scrawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems peculiarly paradoxical that a
cruiser of the United States navy, commanded
by an officer who until recently was at the
head of the Bureau of Naval Intelligence,
should be sent to Japan just at the time when
the American battle-ship fleet having sailed
for the Orient <i>via</i> the south of Africa, has arrived
in Manila Bay. And is it less of a
paradox that one of her officers is the inventor
of a torpedo which is rumored to have the
greatest range of any yet tried in any navy?
Again another officer is known to be an experienced
aeronaut, having been until recently
the instructor with naval flying machines at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Washington. If one will take the roster of
officers and give it a close scrutiny he doubtless
will discover that every method of prying
into the naval preparedness of Japan for war
is represented by an expert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wells looked up from his reading and there
was a flash of fire in his steel-gray eyes.
&#8220;George is a darned hypocrite. He had the
nerve to write this, and then preach to me
about our dishonorable trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how much of this is true. Impey
doubtless furnished him with the data.&#8221; He
seized the sheets, and read on while the clock
ticked the seconds slowly away. Finally he
finished, put the copy into an envelope, and
struggled into his coat. &#8220;This must be in the
&#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217;s&#8217; office this afternoon if it is to
make the sensation intended,&#8221; he muttered
grimly to himself as he pulled his slouch hat
over his thick hair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure and take
it myself,&#8221; he ended decidedly as he shoved
the letter into his inside overcoat pocket and
buttoned it tight before he issued forth into
the street.</p>

<p>About the same time two sailormen were
striding along one of the main thoroughfares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of Tokyo. They both towered head and
shoulders above the people about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been nearly five years since I first
visited our little Japanese brothers. They&#8217;re
a curious lot, but, Bill, there ain&#8217;t nothing soft
about &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boatswain&#8217;s Mate John O&#8217;Neil glanced as he
spoke at his companion, Seaman Bill Marley,
both from the &#8220;Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that war with the Ruskis they were
right up to snuff,&#8221; he continued, as they
strolled along aimlessly. &#8220;They saw their
work and they went for it, and stayed on the
job until it was finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two man-of-war&#8217;s men had come to
Tokyo on the special train for a forty-eight
hours&#8217; liberty in that Eastern capital, and
were enjoying themselves thoroughly. Everywhere
they met welcoming smiles, and even
the little urchins playing in the streets stopped,
and raising their tiny hands aloft, cried
&#8220;Banzai&#8221; as they passed.</p>

<p>The day was balmy; the air laden with perfume
of many flowers. In the shops they had
seen many beautiful things and had spent a
portion of their slender pocket money on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
articles as took their fancy, marveling the
while upon the smallness of the price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Jack, look here; all this war talk is
soap-suds, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; Bill Marley asked.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil contemplated the back of a man a
half a block or so farther up the street before
replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a big hurry about something,&#8221; he
muttered half aloud, and Bill Marley asked,
&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; for he had heard O&#8217;Neil
speak, and thought it might be an answer to
his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about this war talk,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil responded,
his mind reverting from the stranger ahead,
whom he made out to be a European in a
big hurry to get somewhere. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take
no stock in it. There ain&#8217;t nothing that I
can see we&#8217;ve got to fight for, unless it&#8217;s just
to see who&#8217;s the best man. This war business
cost too many people too much money. These
Japs are nice little fellows; they like us and
they want to show us they like us. They are
mighty proud of their knowledge of fighting,
too, and they&#8217;ve got a code of honor they call
&#8216;Bushido,&#8217;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or something like it, which means,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
as far as I can find out, &#8216;If any one insults
you, and you can&#8217;t lick him, cut yourself open
with a sharp knife.&#8217; Now fellows with ideas
like that ain&#8217;t to be monkeyed with. If we
treat &#8217;em square and be careful about treading
on this &#8216;Bushy porcupine,&#8217; they&#8217;ll continue to
yell &#8216;banzai&#8217; at us, but if we get funny and
put it over them in some way, they&#8217;re apt to
tackle even us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we lick them,&#8221; Bill Marley asked,
&#8220;then I suppose they&#8217;ll take to the tall
timbers and disembowel themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the situation,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied,
&#8220;but as far as I can see there ain&#8217;t no
sense in fighting. Can&#8217;t we leave these little
fellows alone with their troubles? Ain&#8217;t we
got enough to do in those South American
republics, with them at each other&#8217;s throats
every month?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Bill Marley acknowledged thoughtfully.
&#8220;Why does any one want to spoil a nice
place like Japan by going to war? I&#8217;d rather
make a liberty here than any place I know&mdash;outside
of the Bowery.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil paid this answer but scant attention.
He had seen the European ahead fairly run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
down the street and become lost within the
crowd. Upon approaching nearer, a piece of
white paper caught the sailor&#8217;s eye as it lay
on the tiny sidewalk, almost on the edge of
the crowd. Had it been dropped by the European
in his haste? The sailors picked it up,
and Marley shoved it down the bosom of his
shirt for safe-keeping. It was a long white
envelope addressed to the &#8220;Editor of the
&#8216;Shimbunshi.&#8217;&#8221; O&#8217;Neil had read the inscription
as Marley held it toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for a yellow journal published in
Tokyo. Hold on to it, Bill,&#8221; he instructed.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a row on here,&#8221; he added excitedly
as they pushed their way forward.</p>

<p>The two men soon realized that this crowd
was more than a simple assemblage on a street
corner. From a swaying motion inside it appeared
that a struggle was in progress at its
centre. They now again saw the stranger
pushing his way through, his head towering
above the shorter Japanese around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it ain&#8217;t a rikisha fight,&#8221; Bill said
eagerly, as he hurried after his companion.
&#8220;These rikisha coolies is mighty mean when
you don&#8217;t give &#8217;em three times the fare.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;Come on, Bill, quick,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed,
but there was scant need for urging. Both
had seen enough to know that what was happening
was a great deal more serious than a
rikisha fight. The midshipmen were in
danger from a mob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your shoulder in the small of my
back and shove,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried excitedly, as
he dived into the crowd thickest about the
machine, scattering the people left and right.
They were at the wheel of the motor car before
the mob could take in the meaning of
this human battering-ram.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row, sir?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked hurriedly,
turning toward the crowd and pulling
up his sleeves in a businesslike way.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ran over a man,&#8221; Phil replied in a
nervous voice. &#8220;I hope he isn&#8217;t dead. They
took him from under the wheels and carried
him over there,&#8221; indicating a small house
about the door of which many curious people
had collected. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we persuade the crowd
to let him go on?&#8221; he added anxiously.
&#8220;They would have killed him a moment
ago.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;WHAT&#8217;S THE ROW, SIR?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>O&#8217;Neil raised his voice and shouted &#8220;Junsa&#8221;
at the top of his lungs several times. Immediately
the crowd moved backward. Three
or four policemen (Junsa) appeared suddenly
as if they had leaped from within the earth
and cleared the way in front of the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them we&#8217;ll answer for his appearance
before the authorities,&#8221; Phil said to O&#8217;Neil, in
his excitement, believing that O&#8217;Neil could
interpret for him. However, he was not far
wrong, for the sailor&#8217;s sign language was quite
clear enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blow your horn and beat it, mister,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil sharply directed the driver of the car.
&#8220;It&#8217;s getting to be a habit with you, I see,&#8221; he
added maliciously to Impey. &#8220;The man in
such a hurry too,&#8221; he murmured as he recognized
the man on the front seat next the
driver.</p>

<p>Impey made a hasty recovery, and with his
horn blowing, the car glided cautiously away,
leaving the Americans to grapple with the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have served him right if they
had given him a sound beating,&#8221; Sydney cried
indignantly a few moments later as they
looked down upon the white face of the victim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
lying on a mat within a tiny store opposite
the scene of the accident. &#8220;Has a doctor
come?&#8221; he asked solicitously; but the Japanese
addressed only shook his head, saying
something in his own language which Sydney
interpreted correctly to mean that he did not
understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t some one get a doctor?&#8221; he
exclaimed. The strain of helplessly watching
the sufferer was becoming unbearable. &#8220;Are
you a doctor?&#8221; he asked as a uniformed naval
officer forced his way through the curious
throng and knelt at the injured man&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>With fascinated eyes the lads watched this
grave little Japanese examine the injured
man. They saw his nervous hands move
quickly over the senseless form, resting momentarily
here and there to make sure before
passing on to other parts of the crushed victim&#8217;s
body. Finally he rose to his feet while
ready hands tenderly lifted the silent figure
to carry him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not die; luckily the wheels did
not pass over him. Only contusion of the
head and a broken leg,&#8221; the little doctor said
in studied English and with a very impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
professional smile, as he shook hands
with the midshipmen. &#8220;I was in the navy
department building, and came as soon as I
was informed. He is an employee in one of
the offices, and was out with a message.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen followed the doctor into
the hallway of the navy building, where the
injured man had been taken. They were
quickly surrounded by naval officers, asking
for the story of the accident. Phil found
himself talking to Lieutenant Takishima,
while behind him stood Captain Inaba listening
eagerly. There seemed to be much concern
over the deplorable affair. Several officers
went out hurriedly and soon returned,
their faces grave, to make their report to Captain
Inaba. What was the meaning of so
much concern over the mishap to a mere employee?</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I not give him something, poor
man?&#8221; Phil inquired anxiously, producing
his purse. &#8220;Of course, Mr. Impey will provide
for him, but maybe a little money would
aid his family.&#8221; He innocently attempted to
put the bank-note into the victim&#8217;s pocket,
but much to his surprise his arm was held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
tightly by Captain Inaba. A look into the
naval man&#8217;s face convinced him that the attitude
of those about them was not friendly.
Did they then blame Sydney and him for the
accident? Surely they could not be so
unfair.</p>

<p>The midshipmen quietly withdrew, seeing
that their presence was a source of embarrassment.
They found O&#8217;Neil and Marley waiting
for them, having engaged and held four
rikishas. All thoughts of the ambassador&#8217;s
reception had quite passed out of the lads&#8217;
minds, so they were soon on their way to
their hotel as quickly as their coolies could
carry them, the sailors bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Marley?&#8221; Sydney asked as
Marley signed them to stop as they alighted
and were entering the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got something important to show
you,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said mysteriously, his face grave,
while Marley nodded soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along then,&#8221; Phil answered, leading
the way through a side entrance which opened
on the court near the rooms assigned the
American naval officers.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil closed the door quietly, while Marley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
nervously put his hand within his sailor
blouse and produced the big envelope which
he had hidden within.</p>

<p>Phil took the proffered letter in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Shimbunshi,&#8217;&#8221; he read aloud. &#8220;Why,
that&#8217;s for a Japanese newspaper published in
Tokyo. Where did you get it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Marley had turned red and was stammering
incoherently. O&#8217;Neil came to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was lying in the street just before we
hit the crowd, sir, and Marley picked it up.
I advised him to keep it snug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must send it to its address; we
have no right to keep it.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s voice was
indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you say, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered
without emotion. &#8220;You notice, sir, it is unsealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was devoured with curiosity to read
the contents. The scene in the hallway of
the navy building now took on a new aspect.
The injured man was Inaba&#8217;s messenger. So
ran Phil&#8217;s thoughts. He had been entrusted
with this letter. He had lost it. That surely
was the cause of the perturbation of the Japanese
naval men. Some naval secret, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
but undoubtedly in Japanese, which they
could not read. The more honorable thing
to do would be to go back post-haste and
deliver the letter to the Japanese navy
department.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in English, sir, and it&#8217;s about us.&#8221;
Marley had found his tongue during the
silence. &#8220;I stole a look while you were in
the building.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s curiosity had beaten down all scruples
of honesty, and his eyes were running rapidly
over the words of the letter. At first only
amusement showed in his face, but it soon
gave place to surprised indignation and anger.</p>

<small>WHO WROTE THE LETTER?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Well</span>, if this isn&#8217;t the most barefaced
treachery!&#8221; Phil exclaimed angrily, as he
handed the letter to Sydney.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Marley stood, caps in hand, both
eager to hear all within the letter. They received
it in their turn, and both, according to
their way, displayed the anger they felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing of this to any one,&#8221; Phil
counseled as the sailors moved toward the
door. &#8220;And, by the way, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;you saw the driver of the motor and also
the man who got in with him.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if you and Marley can find out their
business here in Tokyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s face lighted up in pleasurable anticipation
at the suggestion of detective work.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who got in the motor with
Impey, just before O&#8217;Neil and Marley arrived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
dropped a paper,&#8221; Sydney interjected. &#8220;I
picked it up for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; Phil exclaimed in surprise.
&#8220;What was it like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A long white envelope,&#8221; Sydney replied.
&#8220;I was too excited to notice it particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was thoughtfully silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Sago, the captain&#8217;s steward&#8217;s address,&#8221;
Phil said after a few minutes of deep
thought. &#8220;If you need an interpreter look
him up. Come back here when you have
anything to tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors departed, and the midshipmen
again read the letter for the &#8220;Shimbunshi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No Japanese could write this,&#8221; Sydney
declared. &#8220;This is the work of an Englishman
or American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The writer of this,&#8221; Phil answered grimly,
&#8220;is one of the gang of rascals who have been
for months trying to break up the friendly
relations between Japan and the United States.
Could the man with Impey have dropped it?
O&#8217;Neil spoke of its lying where he had passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He dropped one letter; why not this one
too!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is what happened,&#8221; Phil cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
eagerly, &#8220;then we&#8217;ve found out Impey&#8217;s calling.
He&#8217;s the leader of these conspirators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do with the letter?&#8221; Sydney
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall place it at once in Captain Rodgers&#8217;
hands,&#8221; Phil replied decidedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
much responsibility for us to shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Sydney said gravely, &#8220;then what
was the cause of the constraint in the navy
building? Something was lost by their messenger.
It might have been this letter. Remember,
Taki can write excellent English,
quite as good as this, and the handwriting, as
I remember his, is not unlike it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil whistled softly to show the seriousness
of this thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this letter was composed in the Japanese
navy department,&#8221; Sydney continued
excitedly, &#8220;it means but one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded, his pulse beating faster. It
meant that the Japanese navy department
was itself prejudicing the people against
Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; is the newspaper that
has been most vituperative against everything
American. It then would be the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
organ,&#8221; Phil said grimly and in a lowered
voice. &#8220;The silent partner of the Mikado&#8217;s
ministers. It seems monstrous! I can&#8217;t believe
it possible! And Taki helping to poison
the minds of his people against us after greeting
us so affectionately this afternoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was striving to excuse the people
whom he admired greatly for their wonderful
achievements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we show this letter,&#8221; Sydney suggested,
&#8220;hadn&#8217;t we better try to find its true
source? Let it rest until to-morrow, anyway.
Maybe O&#8217;Neil will be able to find out something
to throw light on its origin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads therefore decided to wait until
morning before giving Captain Rodgers the
highly colored letter whose author attributed
the vilest reasons for the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; visit to
Tokyo.</p>

<p>Even Lieutenant Winston was not taken
into confidence by the midshipmen. They
both rather feared his scepticism. To them
the adventures had become of great importance,
and Winston&#8217;s remarks could have only
thrown cold water upon their boyish enthusiasm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Syd, I believe we have hit upon a big
thing,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, while they were dressing
for the evening. &#8220;This fellow Impey is a
clever rogue, I feel sure of that. He may
even be in the pay of Japan. That may account
for his friendliness with such important
personages as Captain Inaba and the Baron of
the railroad train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be his object?&#8221; Sydney returned
questioningly. &#8220;He must have strong reasons
or else a large salary to serve as an agitator of
that kind. A man must be pretty far in disrepute
to be willing to play the part of a blackmailer,
even if the blackmail is directed upon
a government and not an individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prime minister&#8217;s summer home had
been made into a veritable fairy-land for this
grand ball in honor of the American naval
officers. Every available officer from the
&#8220;Alaska&#8221; was there by nine o&#8217;clock, dressed
in full uniform. The court set of Tokyo was
all present. The Emperor was represented by
the princes and princesses of the blood, who
remained seated while the guests bowed before
them.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney had been greeted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Lieutenant Takishima almost immediately on
their arrival, and to the lads he seemed like
his old self in Annapolis days as he insisted on
leading them by the hand around the great
ballroom, introducing them to one young girl
after another.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! Taki, you&#8217;re as much a fusser
as ever,&#8221; Phil exclaimed good-naturedly
as they arrived at their starting point; the
midshipmen meanwhile having engaged several
dances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very fond of talking to your women,&#8221;
Takishima answered seriously; &#8220;they are so
quick, so witty; not like our women, who are
not allowed to form opinions of anything outside
of the household; but I do not dare to
dance with them; they are so tall and I
am so short. It would make me look so
funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba asks me to say he is very
sorry for his brusqueness to you this afternoon,&#8221;
the officer continued, his voice showing
a trace of embarrassment. &#8220;He did not
come himself. The man Oka was on an important
mission, and he lost a valuable paper
which has not yet been recovered.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Phil and Sydney strove hard to control
their faces, and attempted to appear only
solicitous for the loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite understood,&#8221; Phil commenced,
then he blushed and stammered for fear of
arousing Takishima&#8217;s suspicion. The paper
the sailors had found had not as yet been explained.
&#8220;I mean, I thought it was natural
that he should be abrupt with that poor fellow
lying there hurt by our recklessness,&#8221; he explained
quickly.</p>

<p>Takishima turned his dark almond eyes on
Phil during this attempt to excuse Captain
Inaba&#8217;s apparent rudeness. His subtle mind
was seeking a reason for Phil&#8217;s remark. Could
the document have fallen into the hands of
the Americans? However, he was sure Captain
Inaba would be thorough in his search
even to a careful scrutiny of their rooms at the
hotel.</p>

<p>That the paper would be of great interest to
the Americans, Takishima was sure; it was
in the Japanese characters, but doubtless there
would be some one ready enough to translate
it. It was in the young officer&#8217;s mind to ask
his American friends, frankly, if they knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
where the letter was; but even in his desire to
help Captain Inaba, his great friend, he realized
that a ballroom was hardly the place to broach
such a subject. Poor Inaba, he had been completely
crushed over the loss. It was such an
important and secret paper that it should not
have been trusted to a messenger and last of
all to poor deaf Oka. As to what would happen
to Inaba in case the letter had gone into
American hands, Takishima did not dare
think. He would be irreparably disgraced,
and by the old Samurai law might even be
forced to wipe out the stain of his dishonor by
committing &#8220;hara-kiri.&#8221; Takishima believed
that hara-kiri was a crime. To destroy one&#8217;s
life, no matter how hard living would be, was
by his Western teaching suicide, and a sin
against society. He was not in accord with
this barbaric teaching of feudal Japan.</p>

<p>There had come a lull in the music furnished
by the guards&#8217; band, the same that played
before the Emperor. Phil had nearly forgotten
the presence of the thoughtful lieutenant,
for his own eager eyes had been searching
the ballroom for some one who he knew
was amidst this profusion of bright colors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
The dancers had stopped, and were fast disappearing
from the ballroom floor to seek the
cooler air outside, in the spacious hallways
and porches, draped so artistically with the
national colors of America and Japan.</p>

<p>Helen Tillotson and Winston had joined
the three classmates, and each had penned his
name on her dance card. They were standing
near one of the doors to the garden.
Phil could see the many lanterns flickering
their subtle invitation. Winston still retained
the girl&#8217;s fan, but plunged into conversation
with Takishima. The lad tried not
to listen but could not help catch the words,
&#8220;torpedoes&#8221; and &#8220;distance,&#8221; and it suddenly
dawned upon him that Winston was the
torpedo expert mentioned in the &#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221;
letter. He recalled that Winston
had in the last few months perfected the air
chamber and superheater of the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221;
torpedoes, and an experimental run had given
it a much greater danger radius. How could
the author of the letter know this? Phil
was more perplexed than ever. Sydney, after
writing his name on Helen&#8217;s card, hurriedly
excused himself with an implied intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
of returning instantly. &#8220;Some one I must
see!&#8221; he exclaimed as he hastened off.</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s eyes were directed out upon the
garden, the dimly lighted walks of which
were already dotted with white shadowy
figures from the ballroom.</p>

<p>A moment later Phil and Helen had left
the two naval officers deep in their discussions,
and walked out together into the garden.</p>

<p>They walked silently, admiring the illumination
made with row after row of delicately
tinted Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p>&#8220;We looked for you and Mr. Monroe this
afternoon,&#8221; she said as they reached the seats
of a small pagoda from which they could
look out upon the fairy-like scene about them.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t say you didn&#8217;t know it,&#8221; she
added pointedly, noticing the look in Phil&#8217;s
face, &#8220;for I told Mr. Monroe of it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipman hesitated in some confusion.
He saw that he must take Helen
into his confidence, or seem extremely rude
to his ambassador&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were on the way,&#8221; Phil explained,
&#8220;in Mr. Impey&#8217;s motor car, when we ran over
a Japanese messenger. Afterward it was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
late and we were both so agitated that we
went directly to the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen showed her interest and sympathy
for the victim in many rapid questions, and
Phil thereupon told her the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey will not be here to-night,&#8221; she
said, after Phil had finished his recital. &#8220;I
had a note from him before leaving home, in
which he said he would be detained on business.&#8221;
She was glancing as she spoke at her
dance card: the music had again started, and
the dancers were moving toward the ballroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;This dance is his,&#8221; she added as Phil
made a movement to stand, expecting Helen
would also return to the ballroom. &#8220;Are
you engaged for it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m very glad to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if you don&#8217;t mind we shall stay
here; it&#8217;s too beautiful to go inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen regarded the young man with anxious
eyes as she suddenly asked a question which
had been long in her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why has the &#8216;Alaska&#8217; come to Japan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil looked up, surprise in his face at the
sudden turn in the conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied
honestly; &#8220;just a regulation visit of courtesy,
I suppose. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe in the Japanese? Are they
honestly our friends?&#8221; she asked another
question for an answer to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe they are,&#8221; Phil replied thoughtfully.
&#8220;Our misunderstandings are caused
by the great gulf between the two races. The
Japanese understand us much better than we
do them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think a war is likely?&#8221; she exclaimed
impatiently, not wholly satisfied at
Phil&#8217;s indirect answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not likely,&#8221; he replied quietly, &#8220;but always
possible. Miss Helen, there are people
here in Tokyo, men of influence, who are
working to bring on war between Japan and
our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s blue eyes opened in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked in an excited
whisper.</p>

<p>Phil told her of the conversation he had
heard on the train and also of the letter for
the &#8220;Shimbunshi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face now was rosy with eagerness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;And you and Mr. Monroe are going to
endeavor to discover the identity of these
people,&#8221; she cried enthusiastically. &#8220;I wish
I could help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you can,&#8221; he said quickly, then he
hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you known Mr. Impey, and
what is his business?&#8221; he asked hurriedly, and
in some embarrassment, for he did not know
how close a friend the foreigner might be to
the ambassador&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with it?&#8221; Helen asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you presently,&#8221; Phil insisted,
&#8220;after you&#8217;ve answered my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have known Mr. Impey since we came
to Japan,&#8221; she returned haughtily; &#8220;he is a
very warm friend of father&#8217;s. What his business
is I haven&#8217;t the remotest idea. He owns
a yacht, and an automobile. I don&#8217;t believe
he really has any steady business except
society. One always sees him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled grimly. The girl&#8217;s description
of Impey&#8217;s occupation more than ever made
him feel suspicious. Could he trust himself
to ask another question? He decided to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the risk and brave Helen&#8217;s displeasure if she
divined the course of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Mr. Impey in Yokohama this morning?&#8221;
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sure he was,&#8221; she answered
innocently, not dreaming of Phil&#8217;s reason for
asking the question. &#8220;While we were driving
to the garden f&ecirc;te he told us he had
come up on the train with the American
officers through the help of his friend, Baron
Kosuba.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s eyes were fairly dancing with delight;
but Helen&#8217;s face was turned away; the
music had ceased and the dancers were coming
out into the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Baron Kosuba?&#8221; Phil asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;He
is one of Japan&#8217;s richest men. He is the
president and owner of her largest steamship
company.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would talk to Mr. Impey,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;He told me in strictest confidence
that the Japanese statesmen could not
be trusted&mdash;that they were determined to
force a war very soon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Phil&#8217;s face became suddenly thoughtful as
he felt Helen&#8217;s eyes upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he has been giving the identical medicine
to both sides,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why all this mystery?&#8221; Helen asked,
suddenly remembering that Phil had not as
yet enlightened her. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t Mr.
Impey have been in Yokohama to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent, thinking how best to avert
an awkward situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to insinuate that Mr.
Impey was the man you overheard on the
train?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why, the idea is ridiculous.
He couldn&#8217;t be such a blackguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have been only a coincidence,&#8221;
Phil hastened to say, in an attempt to relieve
the tension, for he saw that Helen was indignant
at his presumption in accusing a friend
of being a traitor. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the man;
his voice was that of an Englishman. Impey
is an Englishman, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not an Englishman,&#8221; Helen exclaimed
eagerly. &#8220;His mother was not English;
she was an East Indian of high rank.
His father was in the British East India Company
first, and afterward in the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Customs service. Mr. Impey was born in the
Orient. He speaks and writes Chinese and
in that way can read the classic Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure that Mr. Impey is
sincere?&#8221; Phil asked. The case in his mind
was quite clear against Impey. His desire
now was to convince Helen and put her on
the guard against him. &#8220;Has he any reason
to dislike Americans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; the girl answered.
&#8220;I have always believed him sincere and very
friendly to us, but you upset all my beliefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am truly sorry, Miss Helen,&#8221; Phil returned.
&#8220;I suppose I should be just and not
condemn him unheard. If you believe in
him I hope I have been mistaken in my
estimate of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As much as Phil desired the companionship
of Helen, whom he had come to admire
greatly, he nevertheless welcomed the interruption
of Sydney&#8217;s coming for his dance.
He was beginning to fear he had said too
much. Takishima and Sydney entered the
pagoda together. After a few moments Phil
found himself alone with his Japanese classmate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Taki, it certainly seems good to see you
so unchanged,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, turning enthusiastically
upon him after the two were
seated. &#8220;You must come on board the
&#8216;Alaska,&#8217; and Syd and I will show you how
you would have been existing if you&#8217;d been
born an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima showed his white teeth in a
smile, through the not too abundant black
moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry,&#8221; Takishima&#8217;s face was again grave
and there was marked hesitancy in his speech,
&#8220;you and I are old friends and classmates. By
birth we are of widely different races. Your
ancestors have been living in what is termed
civilization for some hundreds of years. Mine,
by your standards, have been living in the
dark ages, under a feudal system similar to
that of the days of King Arthur and his
Round Table. It therefore is not odd that
my countrymen and yours hold widely different
views on many subjects. There is no reason,
however, why you and I should not look
into each other&#8217;s hearts and talk as brother to
brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face had gone serious. The playful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
banter on his tongue was nipped in the bud.
He laid an affectionate hand on the young
lieutenant&#8217;s shoulder, as they sat on the bench
of the summer-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Taki? What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, where is the much boasted generosity
of your country? Are all the Lincolns
and the Washingtons dead? Did your people
awaken us from our peaceful, childlike sleep
of medi&aelig;valism, showing us the path to greatness
and civilization, only to make us sorry
that your great namesake, Commodore Perry,
forced us to embrace the new civilization?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand!&#8221; Phil exclaimed
amazedly. &#8220;What has my country done that
you should so condemn it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see to what we are drifting,
Perry?&#8221; Takishima replied excitedly. &#8220;Only
a year ago our two countries were friendly.
Nothing but what was good was being said by
one of the other. My Emperor&#8217;s subjects in
America were everywhere treated kindly, and
here in Japan we bowed respectfully and affectionately
wherever an American appeared.
Now all is different. Each looks upon the
other with suspicion.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;I think you are wrong, Taki,&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
his pulse beating fast at Takishima&#8217;s
words. &#8220;I have not been in America for over
a year, but I am sure no such feeling as you
describe is felt there. Our labor unions have
fought against your countrymen coming to
America because they will work for much less
money than will our own people, and they
will not join the unions, but that is hardly
enough reason for making Japan distrust
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A year ago only it started,&#8221; Takishima
said, scarcely heeding Phil&#8217;s denial. &#8220;First
there were only vague hints, but gradually it
has grown until to-day every move my country
makes is misunderstood and condemned
in your great newspapers, which are the eyes,
ears and brains of your countrymen. We are
doing our duty by China and Korea. We
have been awakened from our long sleep of
inaction, and it is our duty to awaken our
blood brothers. Japan stands in the same
light in the Orient with China and Korea as
your great country with the republics of
South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the newspapers?&#8221; Phil exclaimed smiling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
&#8220;Why, Taki, you can&#8217;t take everything
that&#8217;s said by our newspapers seriously. You
know we have entire freedom of the press.
Our newspapers can say anything. You Japanese
are entirely too sensitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it over-sensitive to be hurt
at hearing that the legislature of one of your
states considered a measure to exclude Japanese
from the state?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face was very grave. As Takishima
had stated, it was only too true.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the measure was lost,&#8221; Phil hastened
to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not before much discussion,&#8221;
Takishima returned, &#8220;which showed us that
our countrymen were not as welcome in
America as yours are in Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is purely commercial,&#8221; Phil declared.
&#8220;We have a tariff to exclude goods made in
other countries; a laborer is as much an article
for purchase as anything else. We cannot
require him to pay duty upon himself in
order that his hire will be the same as that paid
to our own countrymen; so the labor unions
wished to prevent the Japanese laborer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
landing in America. It is only a question of
money, nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are old friends, Perry,&#8221; Takishima
said soberly, drawing nearer to his classmate
and lowering his voice. &#8220;I am in a position
where I hear much that is not intended
for young ears. Our statesmen have
given a life-study to questions of the Orient.
Have yours given these far-reaching, perplexing
questions the attention they deserve?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent. He did not wish to belittle
the statesmen of his country, but he
could but acknowledge that their conditions
were different. A statesman in America was
a very rare and precious person. The entire
government changed every four years; new
statesmen arose every four years to die politically
at the end of their term. Policies,
therefore, were unstable. Only the great publicists
could be depended upon to diagnose a
situation. Phil knew that his country was in
this greatly handicapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki, common sense and justice make
a statesman. Such men are born, and no
amount of study can produce them otherwise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
We have enough such statesmen in
my country,&#8221; he returned proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, you are a faithful champion,&#8221; Takishima
said, an affectionate ring in his voice,
&#8220;but even that cannot lessen our danger. Our
people believe that America is aiming to control
all of China; to use that vast country
as a market for her manufactured articles
that cannot be sold elsewhere. They believe
that Japan will be excluded and sealed forever
within its island kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should they believe such ridiculous
nonsense,&#8221; Phil cried angrily, &#8220;when
there is not an atom of truth in any of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manchuria and Korea,&#8221; Takishima continued,
&#8220;have been won through the spilling
of much precious blood. So you can see how
such thoughts arouse my people. The Emperor
is fearful that something unpleasant
will occur during the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;s&#8217; visit, and
has issued an order from the throne for all to
be courteous to the Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey and the &#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; letter had
danced before Phil&#8217;s mind during this long
talk with Takishima.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has caused this sudden misunderstanding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Taki? Who has kept the discussions
alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It began when your fleet started for Manila
by way of the south of Africa,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;and has steadily increased in intensity
until now, when we are nearer to war than
we have ever been without having it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then in a month more it will die a natural
death,&#8221; Phil said, brightening, &#8220;for the
fleet is to return next month to the east coast
of the United States. The cause then of all
this jingo talk will have been removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A month!&#8221; Takishima exclaimed grimly.
&#8220;Much can happen in that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Japan is truthful when she says she
does not desire war,&#8221; Phil said, &#8220;I can see no
cause for worry. We are not seeking a war.
We have enough to care for without getting
into a fight so far from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can Japan be sure that what
you say is correct?&#8221; Takishima asked quickly.
&#8220;To whom in America can we go to be assured
that she is peacefully inclined?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To our President,&#8221; Phil answered, his
eyes flashing proudly, &#8220;the most powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
leader in the world. If he gives his word it
is law. Even Congress would not dare betray it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I am sure that our
people admire yours. We think your head
may be just a little swollen over your prowess
in war, and would like to see the swelling
subside; but a war with you or any other
country is not our desire now or at any other
time. The United States fights only when its
honor is involved, and not for conquest. If
both countries are honest and do not attempt
to trick each other by threatening to strike in
order to force a favorable action on a measure
or treaty unfavorable to the other, then there
can be no war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will help me to prevent these
misunderstandings?&#8221; Takishima asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day Captain Inaba lost a valuable
paper,&#8221; Takishima added earnestly. &#8220;The
messenger Oka, who was injured, was carrying
it in his hand when he was struck by Mr.
Impey&#8217;s machine. If that paper, translated,
should fall into the hands of indiscreet persons,
it would cause a vastly greater strain on the
friendly relations between our countries.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Phil listened eagerly. Could it be possible
that the paper the sailors had found was the
one in question, and if so did Takishima know
the character of it? Phil recalled quite
clearly the venomous composition, calculated
to arouse the entire Japanese nation against
the American people in general and the
cruiser &#8220;Alaska&#8221; in particular. If this was
the letter and Takishima knew the contents
then there was but one conjecture to make;
that Taki&#8217;s protestations of honesty were
hypocritical. But Phil would not condemn
his classmate unheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the contents of this paper?&#8221;
he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I helped prepare it; it was addressed
to the general board, the Emperor&#8217;s
advisers,&#8221; Takishima answered without hesitation.</p>

<p>Phil breathed more freely. Then this paper
was, as he had begun to suppose, a composition
written by an English speaking person for the
&#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; and was in no way official.
But what of the one Sydney had picked up
and given to Impey&#8217;s companion? Might not
that have been the lost official letter?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; the midshipman urged, for he
knew that Takishima had not opened the
conversation simply to tell of the loss of the
paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba has just sent me word that
he has discovered that one of the two sailors
with you this afternoon picked up an envelope
that in description resembled the lost document.
They drove away with you, so it is
natural to suppose that you know of the existence
of this paper.&#8221; Takishima recalled Phil&#8217;s
evident embarrassment when he had apologized
for Captain Inaba&#8217;s abruptness. He now
regarded the midshipman beseechingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You realize what it will mean to Captain
Inaba if the document is not found or if its
contents are divulged?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will mean disgrace, worse to us than
death.&#8221; Takishima&#8217;s voice was dramatic.</p>

<p>Phil thought quickly.</p>

<p>He would not tell him of the letter to the
&#8220;Shimbunshi.&#8221; Not at least until he had
shown the letter to Captain Rodgers and obtained
his advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki, we didn&#8217;t find your letter,&#8221; Phil assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
him. &#8220;If it ever comes into my hands,
or if I ever have knowledge as to where it is,
I will tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s face had regained its composure.
If the Americans had not the letter then it
would soon be found. It undoubtedly was in
the hands of one of his own countrymen and
the secret service men would soon place it in
Captain Inaba&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Takishima pressed Phil&#8217;s hand as he rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel better now that I have unburdened
myself,&#8221; he said earnestly. &#8220;You can be certain
that Japan wishes above everything to
avoid trouble. That does not mean that we
will neglect our army and navy, for we see that
preparedness for war is the surest road to peace.
If there is any way in which I can aid you,
consider I am always more than ready. Above
everything it should be peculiarly our duty,
yours and mine, to re&euml;stablish the good
opinion which was once held by each nation
for the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil became aware during Takishima&#8217;s
earnest talk that a Japanese policeman was
awaiting attentively just behind him. The lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
saw that he was endeavoring to attract the
lieutenant&#8217;s attention; seeing at once that it
was on a matter of importance he gently
pushed Takishima toward the impatient
guardian of the peace.</p>

<p>Phil waited, silently wondering what manner
of trouble was brewing, for he could see
that Takishima&#8217;s face had become suddenly
serious, while the policeman talked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I feared has happened, Perry,&#8221;
Takishima exclaimed, making a gesture of
finality, as much as to say, &#8220;that&#8217;s the end of
all our good intentions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Monroe and meet me at the entrance to
the street,&#8221; he added promptly. &#8220;If we are to
be on time we must not lose a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman had saluted and hurried
away, while Takishima, after standing for a
moment, silently dejected, straightened up his
broad little shoulders and half ran toward the
house, followed as rapidly by the midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth has happened?&#8221; was Phil&#8217;s
unspoken question; in his mind he was revolving
all the possibilities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>BILL MARLEY&#8217;S FIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving the midshipmen at the
hotel, O&#8217;Neil led his friend Marley to a much
frequented Japanese eating house, on the outskirts
of Shibu Park, kept by an American.
There he believed he would find some one who
could tell him about the mysterious Robert
Impey. The boatswain&#8217;s mate understood
quite plainly that Phil would be able to find
out all that was possible about the man from
the people of his world and that he, Jack
O&#8217;Neil, was to get what information there
was in the keeping of those of the underworld.
In other words, O&#8217;Neil guessed, and
rightly, that Impey, in Phil&#8217;s belief at all
events, was leading a dual life.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Marley seated themselves at a
small table from where they could observe
those about them, for the dining-room was
nearly filled with foreigners. Many waiters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
both men and women, moved quietly about
administering to the wants of their patrons.</p>

<p>The proprietor stood behind a raised
counter and directed the service, collecting
the bills as those who had satisfied their
hunger paid and went their way.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil gave his order to a waitress and at
the same time slipped a hastily penciled note
into the Japanese girl&#8217;s hand, pointing to her
foreign master.</p>

<p>The sailors watched him read the note and
then glance up at them, following the girl&#8217;s
pointing finger. In a few seconds he was
wringing O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, shipmate, how are you?&#8221; he exclaimed.
There was real pleasure in &#8220;Billy&#8221;
Williams&#8217; face. &#8220;This supper is all on me,&#8221;
he cried gladly. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since
you and me have been together, and there
ain&#8217;t nothing in the house too good for Jack
O&#8217;Neil.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil smiled good humoredly, and the
three men sat down at the little table. Williams
called up an assistant, and sent him to
take his place at the cash drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Making money?&#8221; This from O&#8217;Neil.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t losing any, but I miss our
own ships,&#8221; Williams replied, still smiling.
&#8220;The &#8216;Alaska&#8217;s&#8217; the first we&#8217;ve had for
nearly a year. American sailors certainly
spend their money nobly. The foreign sailors
make the eagle squeal on every dollar they
hold before letting go of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the madam?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked. His
eyes were searching the crowd. In his mind&#8217;s
eye he saw a graceful Japanese woman of some
ten years ago, Haru-san by name, whom
Williams had married and settled down after
receiving his honorable discharge from the
United States navy.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s back in the house,&#8221; Williams answered
in an offhand way. &#8220;She don&#8217;t
come into the restaurant any more. If you&#8217;ve
got time, we&#8217;ll go back and see her after you&#8217;ve
finished supper. She often speaks of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>An appetizing supper had been set before
the two sailors, and they without ceremony
commenced the attack. Williams sat watching
them in silence, his smile broadening at
the evident appreciation in his friends&#8217; faces
of the good fare they were eating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, you&#8217;ve been here in Tokyo long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
enough to know who&#8217;s who?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked
the question, shoving back his chair in sign
of the end of his meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any one I don&#8217;t know, you can
bet that Haru-san does,&#8221; was Williams&#8217; quick
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, who is this fellow Robert Impey?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Williams shook his head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know
the party, never comes here,&#8221; was his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he ain&#8217;t our kind,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil returned
with a smile to set the matter straight. &#8220;He
belongs to the court set, drives his own automobile,
knows the American ambassador.&#8221;</p>

<p>Williams appeared to be deep in thought.
&#8220;Believe I have heard of him, but don&#8217;t
know anything against him, if that&#8217;s what
you mean,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil signed by nods of his head that
Williams had guessed rightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! George,&#8221; Williams called, standing
up and beckoning to the owner of the name
sitting in the midst of half a dozen American
sailors at a table across the room. &#8220;Come
here a minute. I want you to meet an old
friend of mine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The man addressed rose slowly, finishing a
story that he had been telling his amused audience,
and to the accompaniment of a loud
chorus of laughter joined Williams and the
two sailormen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Impey,&#8221; George Randall repeated,
after he had shaken hands and heard Williams&#8217;
question, &#8220;is one of the cleverest foreigners
in Japan. No one knows his business
better than himself, and he&#8217;s stingy with his
information about what he&#8217;s here for. Where
did you hear of him?&#8221; A suspicion had entered
Randall&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Marley and I was having an argument,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil hastened to explain. &#8220;You
see, we saw him run down a Jap on the street
with his chug-chug carriage about an hour
ago. Bill and I helped him to get clear and
we was naturally curious to know who we&#8217;d
helped. We heard his name, but that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as far as my knowledge goes too,&#8221;
Randall added. &#8220;He and I revolve in two
widely different orbits.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the above conversation had been
taking place, O&#8217;Neil, sitting with his face
toward the door, had seen the search-light of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
an automobile come quickly up the street and
stop noisily outside of the restaurant. An attendant
had hastened out in anticipation of
influential guests and now returning came directly
to their table. He whispered to Randall,
and the latter rose at once, a half-surprised,
half-guilty expression on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he exclaimed, attempting to
hide his surprise. &#8220;We newspaper men, you
know, are like doctors, subject to a hurry call
at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Randall had left them, O&#8217;Neil grabbed
Marley by the arm and both took a hasty
farewell of Williams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in to-morrow for breakfast, Billy,&#8221;
he said, giving no explanation of his sudden
change of plans.</p>

<p>The sailor hurried after the receding figure
of Randall. He saw him go direct to the waiting
machine, and without a word jump in.
The auto leaped forward, and as it passed under
the arc light at the corner of the street,
O&#8217;Neil received his reward in recognizing the
man of whom he had been seeking information
and with them also was Impey&#8217;s companion
of the afternoon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;So Randall, after all, must know something
more than he wished to acknowledge
about Robert Impey!&#8221; was O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s thought.
He stood undecided for the fraction of a minute,
thinking quickly and silently. Here was
their opportunity to find out about the man
in whom the midshipmen appeared to have
taken more than a passing interest. It was
really too good a chance to lose, at least, without
trying. O&#8217;Neil was conscious of a half
dozen rikishas which had hurriedly disentangled
themselves from the score or more
others outside Tokyo&#8217;s favorite sailor restaurant,
and were silently waiting, their shafts lowered,
for the sailors to enter. On the other side
of the street a victoria was standing, the driver
on the box seat, his eyes on the two Americans.</p>

<p>A nod from O&#8217;Neil was enough to cause
him to snap his reins on the sleepy horses&#8217;
backs and in a few more seconds the boatswain&#8217;s
mate had pushed the obedient Marley
in and given a quick order to the mafoo at
his side.</p>

<p>At breakneck speed the carriage rattled
down the macadam road after the slowly dissolving
light of the automobile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Bill, there ain&#8217;t the ghost of a show of
catching those men,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil confided, &#8220;and
if we did we&#8217;ve got nothing against them.&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil glanced in amused interest at his
friend, whose eyes were fairly bulging with
excitement at the thought of an interesting
chase after a possible criminal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought by the way you shoved me into
this sea-going hack that you&#8217;d caught &#8217;em
with the goods,&#8221; declared the disappointed
seaman in an injured tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gent on the box seat will soon be
losing them,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate declared
quietly while he gazed indifferently ahead.</p>

<p>The streets were crowded with people, many
carrying lighted paper lanterns, and through
these the carriage was being driven at a most
alarming pace in the endeavor to keep the
automobile in sight.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was correct in his surmise, for presently
the carriage slowed to a walk, while the
little mafoo had dropped down from his seat
by the driver and with many low bows and
polite speeches, of which the sailors could
only guess the purport, announced that, &#8220;The
honorable automobile had been swallowed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a dragon, or else vanished into thin air.&#8221; At
least this would have been the literal translation
of the poetic speech if O&#8217;Neil and Marley
could have correctly translated it into
their own language.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil gave a few quick orders in his
sailor Japanese to the mafoo, who nodded
his smiling face in sign of understanding, and
shortly the carriage turned up a less crowded
street, while again the little horses were trotting
gayly along, the shrill cry of the mafoo
being raised periodically in warning the
pedestrians plodding slowly along in the
middle of the street; for in some streets in
Japan sidewalks as yet are unknown luxuries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should that fellow Randall tell us
he knew nothing of this Mr. Impey&#8217;s affairs?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said, more as an introspection than
with the hope that Marley could explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always suspicious of these beachcombers
in foreign ports,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s
mate added; &#8220;they get sort of denationalized
after they&#8217;ve been living apart from their own
people, and they can&#8217;t always be trusted to
play fair. Randall is an American, that&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
sure thing; you can&#8217;t miss the Broadway
accent when you hear it so far from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>While O&#8217;Neil was yet carrying on his one-sided
conversation the carriage had stopped,
and the mafoo was knocking loudly at the
door of a Japanese house in one of the less
pretentious parts of the city. After the occupants
of the house had gone through the
usual formula to discover the identity of their
unexpected visitors, the door was opened and
the two sailors were asked to enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Sago in?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked the shy girl
who was holding the lantern inside the dark
little anteroom, where visitors were expected
to remove their shoes before entering the
house. She nodded, and in her high-pitched
voice a summons was directed upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to drag you out this time of the
evening, Sago,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil explained as, in answer
to the girl&#8217;s call, the captain&#8217;s Japanese
steward came down the stairs to meet them,
&#8220;but we need your help, so I looked you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago&#8217;s sphinx-like face did not portray the
surprise which O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s words might have
been expected to cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please come inside,&#8221; the steward urged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
&#8220;I wish to introduce you to my cousin and
his family.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Marley readily followed the
steward, while curious Japanese of all ages
appeared mysteriously from many directions
to gaze upon their visitors.</p>

<p>Sago motioned with his hand to a Japanese
of about his own age, which might be
anything from forty upward, standing at the
head of the landing. The Oriental bowed
low with a loud hiss of his breath through
his close shut teeth, while O&#8217;Neil and Marley
insisted upon a good American hand-shake.
The same process was gone through with about
a dozen people who congregated about the
sailormen. This formality over, the host
clapped his hands and at once the women
scurried away, like a covey of partridges,
soon reappearing with refreshments, the usual
cakes and tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your friends speak English?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked in his usual direct way, avoiding unnecessary
and useless ceremony.</p>

<p>Sago shook his head with an amused smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed. &#8220;Then I can
tell you at once why we&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Sago listened quietly while O&#8217;Neil told him
of the automobile accident to the messenger
Oka and the finding of a letter near where
the man was injured, but he gave the steward
no further information as to its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we want to do,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is to
find this man Oka and see if he lost it, for he
was on a message from the navy department,
and Mr. Perry believes that the officials there
were much more annoyed over the loss of
something than over the injury to the
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago&#8217;s little almond eyes shone with excitement.
&#8220;I have heard of it already. Oka
lives only a short distance from here, and is
a friend of my cousin,&#8221; he replied in quaintly
pronounced English. &#8220;He is hurt badly, but
he will not die. My cousin has already been
to visit him. The letter he lost was an important
one, and he is more sick over that
than his wounds. Come, we shall go and
pay a call on the injured man,&#8221; he added
leading the way.</p>

<p>Leaving the house after saying good-bye
very ceremoniously to Sago&#8217;s friends, the two
Americans and the steward entered the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and under the latter&#8217;s guiding hand soon
reached the small wooden cottage where lived
the injured messenger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a gift for him from the young
American officers,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil explained to
Sago as they were admitted by a comely
Japanese woman.</p>

<p>Oka was lying on his mats in one corner
of the small living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as clean as the quarter-deck,&#8221; Marley
exclaimed admiringly, glancing critically
about the tidy room.</p>

<p>The woman noiselessly glided to her husband&#8217;s
side, kneeling at his head to tell him
who his visitors were.</p>

<p>Over the man&#8217;s pale features came an expression
of sudden joy as he glanced up at
the two American giants, whose huge bulk,
for both were over six feet tall, quite filled
their part of the tiny room, while a faint voice
asked a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks you have brought back the
document he lost,&#8221; Sago interpreted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to describe it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says it&#8217;s large, with the big red seal
of the Emperor, and is addressed in black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
characters on the outside.&#8221; Sago had put the
question and gave the sick man&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; Marley blurted out
thoughtlessly, having been eagerly listening,
mouth wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just tell him we&#8217;re sorry, but we didn&#8217;t
find his letter;&mdash;and say we came to give
him this from the American officers,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
said, passing Sago the money that Phil had
given him, &#8220;and tell him to let you or your
cousin know if he needs more.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s soft heart was touched and by
mutual consent both he and Marley pressed
into the woman&#8217;s hand at parting amounts
of money which to her were large, but to the
Americans meant simply a small amount of
self-sacrifice and one day less liberty with
money in their pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sago, you can go back to your
happy family now,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said banteringly
as the three reached the waiting carriage,
&#8220;unless of course you have in mind something
entertaining for Bill and me; he&#8217;s in need
of a little diversion, ain&#8217;t you, Bill?&#8221; with a
poke in the seaman&#8217;s ribs. &#8220;You&#8217;re as glum
as an oyster.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Marley gave a forced smile. He recognized
his mental inferiority to O&#8217;Neil and was content
to listen in silence.</p>

<p>Sago gave orders to the mafoo, and the
three were soon on the way back to the main
thoroughfares of the city.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up, after about a half
hour&#8217;s drive, in front of a Japanese theatre.
O&#8217;Neil could not, of course, read the posters,
but from the grotesquely painted pictures on
sign boards in front of the entrance he saw
that it was a naval play.</p>

<p>Sago bought the tickets, and they were
shown seats in a small box close to the stage.
O&#8217;Neil saw there were many American uniforms
about the theatre and that the stage
was draped with American and Japanese
colors.</p>

<p>The curtain had already risen and the play
was in progress.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil could not understand the language
spoken, but the character of the play was
only too evident. The scene was laid during
a war between Japan and some foreign
country.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil sat an amused spectator, but Marley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
had soon passed the amused stage. O&#8217;Neil
watched him with almost as much relish as he
did the play itself. Marley at first was interested,
then excited, and last angry. When an
American naval officer, for he told O&#8217;Neil in
a sullen growl that was the intention of the
queer uniform displayed by the villain, was
shown to be rude to a Japanese lady of high
rank and the hero, a Japanese naval lieutenant,
interfered and vanquished by sword play
his much bigger antagonist, it proved all
O&#8217;Neil could do to suppress the irate sailorman,
who would have gone to the American
officer&#8217;s aid. Then the tide turned and a
party of foreign sailors marched to the rescue
of their officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nerve of those fellows, carrying our
flag,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, for the first time
showing his displeasure.</p>

<p>Marley was uttering imprecations under his
breath; his strong hands were clutching the
brass railing in front of the box.</p>

<p>Then on the stage the tide of battle turned;
a company of Japanese sailors swarmed from
the wings, rolling over their enemies like ten-pins.
The American flag fell to the ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
where it lay, while the stage foreigners beat a
hasty and inglorious retreat.</p>

<p>Before O&#8217;Neil could fathom the actions of
Marley, the sailor had leaped over the low
railing on to the small stage and within ten
feet of the insulted flag. So quickly was it
done, that those in the audience, so absorbed
had they been in the scene before them, had
not differentiated the real American sailor
from the imitations. Even the actors were
not aware that a newcomer with a feeling akin
to murder in his heart was in their midst.</p>

<p>The faithful Jack O&#8217;Neil had sat spellbound
for the fraction of a second, undecided
what action should be taken. Sago&#8217;s eyes
danced with excitement. Fully three-quarters
American at heart, having lived fifteen years
in the United States navy, he was as much out
of sympathy with this quarrel-breeding play
as was O&#8217;Neil himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring the manager,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried suddenly,
shoving the steward out of the box.
&#8220;Tell him to call the police, for there&#8217;s going
to be the prettiest little boxing match he&#8217;s
ever seen,&#8221; and with that he was on the stage
in Bill Marley&#8217;s footsteps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>O&#8217;Neil was close to Marley; in another step
he could have laid hands upon him and
carried him, if resistingly, to the box; but unfortunately
for this peaceful intention of the
boatswain&#8217;s mate, one of the Japanese actors
was due to pick up the fallen flag and wave
it in triumph above his head. His cue had
come just as Marley&#8217;s hand was reaching out
for the staff. Their hands nearly met and
then Bill Marley&#8217;s doubled up, shot straight
from the shoulder, and with terrific force,
directly into the surprised actor&#8217;s face; he
fell to the floor with a very unstagelike thud.</p>

<p>Yet even then the actors seemed blissfully
unconscious that anything unusual was happening
and it was not until nearly a dozen
had gone down under the trip-hammer blows,
measuring their length on the stage, that the
situation was understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come away, you blooming idiot!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed, grasping Bill Marley&#8217;s collar and
dragging him backward, still waving madly
the flag he had succeeded in rescuing.</p>

<p>But Bill Marley was in no mood to be led
like a lamb by the collar even by his friend
O&#8217;Neil. His fighting blood was aroused.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
His slow mind had been deeply outraged by
this evident insult to his countrymen. His
thoughts were alternating between the vague
belief that it was his duty to contend single
handed with those on the stage, erasing the
impression of a Japanese victory, and that those
impersonating American sailors needed only
his leadership to turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you little midgets!&#8221; His voice
was loud and angry, but the firm twist which
O&#8217;Neil had given his wide sailor collar nearly
stifled the encouraging words that were to follow
for the benefit of the vanquished stage
foreigners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me and we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The
rest was only a gurgle, for O&#8217;Neil had encircled
the excited sailor&#8217;s neck with a strong
arm and had lifted him fairly off his feet.</p>

<p>The next second the boatswain&#8217;s mate had
let go of his companion and the two were
standing at bay against a score of infuriated
Japanese, who had suddenly become cognizant
of the true conditions.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was still dizzy from the effects of a
blow on the back of the head, received while
he was yet struggling with Marley. Now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
usually cool-headed petty officer was white
hot with anger and resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them get a hold on you, Bill,&#8221;
was O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s warning, hissed through his
closed teeth, while his two fists were driving
forward like battering-rams.</p>

<small>THE SECRET DOCUMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> reached the ballroom just as the
music had stopped, and looked quickly about
for Sydney. He saw him at the far corner of
the room and hurried to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, get your coat and hat and meet me
at the door, quick!&#8221; he whispered excitedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay to explain if necessary,&#8221;
he added, glancing at Helen, the centre of a
group of officers.</p>

<p>Sydney would have asked for an explanation,
but a look at his friend&#8217;s face showed
him that it was a matter of grave concern.
Helen became suddenly conscious of something
unusual. She had caught the danger
signals in the excited faces of the midshipmen
as she glanced their way just as Sydney
was on the point of leaving.</p>

<p>Phil knew that some explanation would be
necessary. &#8220;Go on, Syd,&#8221; he urged; &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
Miss Tillotson and then join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had gone, picking his way across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the crowded room. Helen was standing beside
Phil, her eyes dilating with apprehension.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she exclaimed in a low voice.
&#8220;Has anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil cast about for appropriate words to
explain something which he himself could
only guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I leave you?&#8221; he began tentatively;
&#8220;for I must hurry if we are to be of
any service.&#8221; The officers who a moment before
were with her had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I go with you?&#8221; Her face was
flushed and her eyes bright with excitement
at the thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know where we are going,&#8221;
he replied, his voice deprecating the idea of
her accompanying them. &#8220;It might be something
serious. I couldn&#8217;t think of putting
you in any danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was relieved to see Lieutenant Winston
making his way toward them. He waited
impatiently until Winston reached Helen&#8217;s
side and then hurried away without a word
of further explanation.</p>

<p>Outside the brightly lighted entrance Takishima
was waiting; three rikishas stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
ready, and the three classmates lost no time in
jumping in. Takishima quietly gave the
directions, and the next moment they were rolling
rapidly along the evenly paved boulevard.
Takishima&#8217;s rikisha was in the lead, while
Sydney and Phil trailed after in single file.
The Japanese policeman ran along at Takishima&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>Phil was in an agony of suspense. He
longed to ask what the trouble was, but to do
so he would have had to shout at the top of
his voice. He thought over all the things
that might have happened, becoming more
anxious as the minutes dragged by. He saw
that his coolie was lagging behind, while
Sydney&#8217;s kept close up to Takishima.</p>

<p>Phil called loudly the word he had heard
meant hurry, &#8220;haiaku,&#8221; but the distance between
Sydney and himself slowly increased.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s coolie was evidently giving out; he
could not keep up the pace set by Takishima.
Phil was on the point of getting down and
running to catch up. He was sure he could
easily overtake them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Phil&#8217;s rikisha stopped, and the
coolie lowered his shafts to the ground, breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
heavily and wiping his face with a large
handkerchief. The lad glared at the Japanese
angrily and roundly berated him for his incompetence,
but he soon realized that he was
but wasting precious moments; his companions
were now far ahead. He gazed about
him anxiously. The narrow street was dark
and deserted, the road ahead was empty.
Takishima and Sydney had turned to the right
or left, but in which direction Phil had not
seen. Planting his cap firmly on his head the
midshipman ran swiftly down the street.</p>

<p>A cry for help came feebly to his ears. The
lad stopped abruptly, his heart beating wildly,
for the cry was in English. He saw he was in
the old business section of Tokyo; the houses
were mostly two-storied. Again a cry came
to him faintly, as if a man were being throttled
in the house beside him. Phil sought in vain
for an entrance, shouting a word of encouragement.
What could it be? Was an American
sailor being robbed? There was no room for
further doubt; a high piercing cry of a man in
mortal fear filled the air, and suddenly died
abruptly away. There was evidently not a
moment to lose, but where was the entrance?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
A dark alley caught his eye a few feet ahead,
and down this narrow lane Phil turned
quickly. A door on the right stood open; a
flight of steep steps led to the second floor.
Floundering noisily in the dark he rushed on.
Reaching the landing, he perceived a light
shining through a chink in the farther wall.
With pulse throbbing loudly in his ears he
stopped guardedly to listen. A scratching
noise of a struggle came indistinctly to him.</p>

<p>What should he do? How many ruffians
must he face? The lad suddenly remembered
that he carried no arms, while the robbers inside
must be well provided. While he yet
hesitated a door suddenly opened, and the hallway
was flooded with light. On the floor of a
large room two men were struggling, while on
the threshold stood a Japanese quietly watching
the unequal battle. His back was turned
to Phil. Spellbound, stupefied, the youngster
stood scarcely out of arm&#8217;s reach of this trim,
stocky figure, garbed in the usual costume of a
man of the middle class. Phil saw that he
must act. To retreat would only cause his
discovery and then the little Japanese would
be forced to attack. Phil held himself rigid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Silently he edged nearer the unconscious
observer of the struggle; the man on the floor
was now lying almost motionless, while the
figure above him clung closely to him. Phil
had reached the very edge of the door, and his
victim was yet unconscious of his presence.
For the fraction of a second the lad hesitated.
A thought as terrifying as unbidden had come
into his mind. Were these men detectives?
If so he would be assaulting the Japanese
police. Then all precaution was swept aside,
for he remembered the cry for help was in English.
He could not tell whether the victim on
the floor was a sailor or not, but his spirit of
chivalry spurred him on to take the part of
the weaker.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE JAPANESE GENTLEMAN<br />
WENT DOWN</i></p>

<p>A loose board under Phil&#8217;s feet suddenly
creaked with a ghastly sound, causing the man
at the door to start and turn his face toward
the hall. In that fleeting second Phil read
authority and character in the quiet aristocratic
face, and the next moment the Japanese gentleman
went down under a sledge-hammer blow
from Phil&#8217;s fist. The midshipman had mapped
out his battle plan. He saw the man who had
nearly squeezed out the life of the victim on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the floor was powerful, and in a hand-to-hand
fight Phil with all his muscular development
might be worsted. The lad could take no
chances. The first blow had been delivered so
quietly that the second man had not divined
what was going on behind him until a blow
on the head from a heavy chair in the midshipman&#8217;s
hands caused him to relax his
muscular fingers from the blackened throat of
Robert Impey.</p>

<p>Phil gazed terrified about him. Three men
lay motionless on the floor, while two of them
had been stricken by his own hands. The
first to fall lay deathly pale on the floor.
Phil leaned over and listened for his heart
beat. He had delivered a blow which he
knew could hardly kill, but in the stillness of
the room he would not trust his own judgment.
At the man&#8217;s side, as if it had fallen
from his hand, lay a large white envelope.
Phil grasped it eagerly. The seal was broken,
and inside lay a dozen official sheets of Japanese
writing. On the outside were great black
characters and the gold seal of the Emperor,
now torn and mutilated.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart rose in his throat as he suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
realized the meaning of the attack on
Impey. These men whom he had just rendered
senseless were employees of the navy
department&mdash;secret service men. They had
tracked Impey, believing he had the stolen
document. The lad, in a fever of dread,
crossed to the table and extinguished the
light, and then he crept away down the
creeking dark stairs, his brain in a tumult.
Reaching the street, he gazed fearfully about
him. The place was deserted. He walked a
block and then broke into a run, fleeing from
the horror behind him. Not knowing which
way to turn, he kept straight on until he saw
several rikishas coming toward him, when he
abruptly turned to his right and ran faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil! Hold up! Wait!&#8221; came joyfully
to him as he slackened speed and allowed his
companions to overtake him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve wasted nearly a quarter of an hour
looking for you!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed as Phil
trotted breathlessly at his side. &#8220;What have
you been doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil evaded the question, breathing heavily
as an excuse for not talking. A terrible guilt
was on his mind. The secret and important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
letter lost by the messenger Oka, containing
that which if known by America might strain
the relations between the two countries, lay
next his rapidly beating heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki says it&#8217;s a riot,&#8221; Sydney returned.
&#8220;There you are!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing.
They had emerged into the lighted thoroughfare,
and Phil&#8217;s question was answered.
Scarcely four blocks down the street a great
crowd could now be seen completely filling
the street.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s pulses beat faster. A riot&mdash;and
American sailors the cause! At this time
it might lead to grave consequences.</p>

<p>Takishima had stopped precipitously; it
was too dark to see his face, but his voice
expressed quite distinctly the anxiety he
felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;How has this happened? Some one shall
suffer for this blunder!&#8221; he exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>The mob was pressing toward the brightly
lighted entrance to the theatre, but the doors
were closed, barring its entrance. Though
there were many policemen present, they
seemed unable to control the ever-increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
crowd, whose angry voice could be heard,
raised ever louder and louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a case for soldiers!&#8221; Takishima
had cried out in English, and in his excitement
talking to the little guide, who stood
mute and mystified.</p>

<p>Across the street Takishima darted, telling
the midshipmen to wait where they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all their training for discipline, the
Japs are just like any one else.&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s
voice betrayed his excitement, but he felt he
must say something to relieve the tension.
&#8220;Winston should be here to see this. No
riots in Japan!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gulped hard. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening inside?&#8221;
he gasped. All thoughts of the two
men he had rendered unconscious were forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two hundred of our men in
Tokyo; if they hear of this they will come
on a run from all over the city.&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s
diagnosis was not reassuring.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fight between our men and a mob
would mean indemnity, for some of them
would be sure to be killed and wounded,&#8221;
Phil said tensely. &#8220;Do you recall the Chile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
trouble, when we nearly came to war over just
this same kind of thing?&#8221; Phil&#8217;s thoughts
were pessimistic. Both lads were aware of
the terrible possibilities. They thoroughly
understood the workings of their sailors&#8217;
minds. Once they heard their companions
were in trouble the American sailormen would
flock to the rescue. &#8220;My countrymen&mdash;right
or wrong,&#8221; is ever their motto.</p>

<p>The impatient midshipmen could stand the
strain of inaction no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Taki? Why doesn&#8217;t he return?
Where did he go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Forgetting in their excitement the inability
of their guide to speak English, they were
pulling him violently by the arm toward the
rioters, but the little policeman had received
his orders, and remained firmly planted where
Takishima had left him.</p>

<p>The naval officer suddenly reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have telephoned,&#8221; was his reassuring
greeting. &#8220;There&#8217;s a back entrance to the
theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four were retracing their steps. An
alley, dimly lighted and deserted, opened before
them and, led by Takishima, they rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
down and through its many turnings. A
heavy door barred their further progress.
With hearts beating tumultuously they listened
to the babel of angry voices from within.</p>

<p>The door was locked. The combined effort
of the four failed to discover a weakness in
the solid wood.</p>

<p>The midshipmen gazed wildly about for a
means of breaking the lock.</p>

<p>Takishima soon solved the difficulty. The
policeman, agile as a cat, was scaling the side
of the house. Above him was a window
through which a light was shining. Breathlessly
and impatiently they waited while he
climbed slowly upward. Then he disappeared
through the window and after a few anxious
moments the door was opened and they
rushed within, securely locking the door after
them. Up the stairs they ran, and then suddenly
the full magnitude of the situation
burst upon them.</p>

<p>A score or more of American sailors had
captured the theatre stage and, with clubs and
sticks stripped from the scenery, were holding
at bay several hundred infuriated Japanese.</p>

<p>Phil recognized O&#8217;Neil and Marley in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
foremost ranks of the defenders, and his heart
sank, for he realized that O&#8217;Neil would not
abet a fight without real provocation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to your men. I&#8217;ll hold the crowd
in check until the soldiers come,&#8221; Takishima
exclaimed, as he threw off his cape and stood
in full evening uniform, his golden epaulettes
glistening brightly and his war medals sparkling
on his breast. He walked out fearlessly
between the sailors and the clamoring crowd.
Phil and Sydney had placed themselves between
him and their own men to protect him
from a chance blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back, men, all of you. Do you realize
what you are doing?&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s and Phil&#8217;s
voices were tense with anger and excitement
as they pressed the sailors away from their
foes. &#8220;You, O&#8217;Neil, leading this disgraceful
row!&#8221; Phil cried out accusingly and in tones
that at the same time expressed the lad&#8217;s bitter
disappointment upon seeing the boatswain&#8217;s
mate involved in what appeared to
him to be a disorderly fight against well-intentioned
Japanese citizens.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t O&#8217;Neil, sir, what started it.&#8221;
Bill Marley&#8217;s voice was raised excitedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
&#8220;This is what they was dragging on the stage,
sir, wiping their clogs on, and the man what
carried it wasn&#8217;t no Jap. I can take my oath
on that. He &#8216;beat it&#8217; when he seen there
was a row on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen opened their eyes in
amazement as Marley showed the tattered
American flag in the defense of which the
American sailors from all over the theatre had
collected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that now!&#8221; Phil waved for
silence as several excited voices were raised
expressing forcibly the desire to be allowed to
clean out the place and revenge the insult to
their flag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see by Marley&#8217;s evidence that it
was fixed up on you?&#8221; Phil exclaimed, grasping
at a straw. &#8220;The man with the flag was
not a Japanese. Who was he? A sneaking,
cowardly foreigner, anxious to bring about a
conflict between you American sailors and the
citizens of Japan.&#8221; Phil was eloquent in his
anger and mortification. &#8220;And you, led into
the trap like lambs. Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of
yourselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could we&#8217;ve done, sir?&#8221; An oppressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
silence had descended upon the sailors;
but a single one mustered up courage to
half defend his companions&#8217; actions. &#8220;We
couldn&#8217;t just sit tight and watch; now could
we, sir?&#8221; This last was said appealingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I suppose it was natural,&#8221; Phil admitted
grudgingly, &#8220;but now you know that
you&#8217;ve been &#8216;buncoed,&#8217; just turn about there
and we will try to smuggle you out without
another disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima was at a loss to understand the
cause of the trouble. His great fear was that
it had come about through the general ill
feeling being spread broadcast in Japan by
the Japanese newspaper, the &#8220;Shimbunshi.&#8221;
As Marley called the midshipmen&#8217;s attention
to the flag, the lieutenant turned about hastily,
his face showing perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;An American flag,&#8221; he exclaimed in
English. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand. This is a
scene from our last war. Could it have been
a plot? You say the man who carried it was
a foreigner. Yes, it was a plot, devised to
bring on a fight between you and our
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Impey, as he lay unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
on the floor of his office with the two men
who had endeavored to take from him the
stolen document, themselves senseless near
him, might, if he had known, felt proud of
the plot which had all but succeeded in precipitating
a riot. While the events at the
theatre were taking place the two defeated
secret service men slowly came to consciousness.
Impey lay inert, half dead on the
floor. They rose defeated, mystified, for
neither had seen his assailant. The precious
document had gone. They quietly slunk
off down the stairs to lay before their chief,
Captain Inaba, the sad story of their failure
after having the lost paper within their
grasp.</p>

<p>The American sailors on the stage were
lost in admiration at the dignified manner in
which Lieutenant Takishima stemmed the
tide of anger. At first beyond control, threatening
to attack the score of sailormen who
had outraged the spirits of those who had
fallen in their last war, the crowd grew
quieter until the people suddenly became
silent, intently listening to the lieutenant&#8217;s
calmly spoken words. What he was saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the Americans did not know, but they saw
that he held their attention upon an order
worn upon the breast of his full dress uniform.
It was the order of the rising sun; the sacred
emblem of their Emperor was the mystic
talisman that cast an hypnotic spell over
that vast assemblage and forced them to listen
to reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the most marvelous thing I&#8217;ve
ever seen.&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s excited whisper brought
forth what was almost a cheer from the
astounded Americans.</p>

<p>The Japanese audience gave way; moving
as one man back toward their seats, their
upturned faces were again good-natured.</p>

<p>Loud cheers of &#8220;banzai&#8221; echoed through
the theatre, while several strong voices were
raised at different points of the house, followed
by cries of agreement from the multitude.</p>

<p>Takishima had turned toward the Americans,
and was speaking to them in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;My people are sorry that this has occurred,
and desire to say that they honor the
Americans for their patriotism. They did
not understand the reason for the interruption,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
but now that they see, they wish to beg
the pardon of the sailors.&#8221; Phil as spokesman
answered by proposing three cheers for
the Japanese nation, which were given with a
will, and the irrepressible Marley waved his
flag, which had been the innocent cause of
the trouble, high in the air.</p>

<p>The audience filed out of the theatre in
orderly fashion, and as the wide doors were
thrown open the midshipmen saw drawn
up across the street a company of regular
soldiers, those who had been summoned by
Takishima.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would advise getting your men out by
the back entrance.&#8221; Takishima was smiling,
but his face was pale and his dark eyes bright
with suppressed excitement. The lads noticed
that the hand which raised his cloak trembled
violently. Then they realized for the first
time that the ordeal through which this
youngster, scarcely a year older than themselves,
had passed, had been one requiring
every ounce of his nerve and grit. One mistake
and the tide might have been turned
against him, and the sacred order on his
breast, the &#8220;rising sun of the second class,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
would have been defiled and himself dishonored
in the eyes of his brother officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although Taki speaks our language the
working of his mind is as different from ours
as is the East from the West,&#8221; said Sydney.
&#8220;What have we in our country symbolic of
majesty or power?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.
&#8220;If you or I had attempted to quell a disturbance
in a New York theatre what could
we use to bring the scattered ideas of the vast
assemblage together?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil silently pointed to the flag as yet
firmly clutched in Marley&#8217;s hand. Sydney
nodded, half convinced only that his countrymen&#8217;s
patriotism could be aroused by it to the
point of obedience to a stripling&#8217;s orders.</p>

<p>A blush of shame crept into Phil&#8217;s face as
he suddenly remembered the secret document
in his pocket. Would it not be a courteous
act to give it over at once to Takishima to
restore it to those who were anxiously searching
through the entire city and who would
be forever disgraced if it fell into the hands
of the agents of a foreign power?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>MISUNDERSTANDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Honorable Henry Tillotson was much
agitated. The night before he had been the
honored guest of Count Kure, the great prime
minister of Japan, and his impressions had
been indeed reassuring. The prime minister
had himself acknowledged the growing confidence
with which diplomatic relations had
proceeded. Then had come the account of
the fight between sailors from the American
cruiser and Japanese citizens, showing that ill
feeling existed between the people of the two
nations, a most disquieting sign. And this
was the day for Captain Rodgers&#8217; presentation
to the Emperor. The President of the United
States had sent by this special naval envoy
an autograph letter to the Mikado, the contents
of which no one, not even the Secretary
of State in Washington, knew. The fact that
there was a letter had leaked out in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
mysterious way, but Captain Rodgers had
never affirmed or denied its existence.</p>

<p>Leaning back in his chair near the ambassador&#8217;s
desk was Mr. Impey. A few scratches
on his forehead, and a bandage about one
wrist were the only outward signs of his struggles
of the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, I now have positive
information of Japan&#8217;s intentions, and it is no
less than a contemplated seizure, by force if
necessary, of the entire new Chinese navy as
soon as it has entered the Yellow Sea.&#8221;
Impey&#8217;s voice was low, but in the still room
the startling words caused the ambassador to
glance uneasily about as if he feared the presence
of an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proofs,&#8221; the ambassador exclaimed
excitedly. &#8220;I dare not be mistaken if I
should cable this to my government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret to say I have not the proofs.
They were taken from me last night. I
would have laid them before you, only for a
misfortune. My house was entered last night
by armed men who overpowered me. When
I came to my senses the document was gone.
It probably is now in the hands of the Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
officials who lost it. The seal was broken,
and knowing that I can translate the Japanese
characters they will know that its contents
are no longer a secret. My yacht is
waiting me in Yokohama with steam up, for
I dare not trust myself longer in Japan. I
should now be on my way. My British
citizenship would not save me.&#8221; Impey&#8217;s
face showed his eagerness to be gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you tell me more fully what was
in this document? This is a very grave
situation, Mr. Impey, and my government is
under great obligations to you for bringing
this information to me. If you believe that
your safety is endangered I shall be glad to
offer you an asylum here in the legation or
on board the &#8216;Alaska.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The ambassador&#8217;s usually composed aspect
had entirely vanished; nervously his fingers
drummed on the desk, while his eyes flashed
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter was lost when my machine ran
down a messenger who had been entrusted
with it,&#8221; Impey replied. &#8220;I cannot tell you
now how it came to fall into my hands, but
it did, and I spent last evening translating it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and committing it to memory. It was rather
long; if you wish I can write its purport.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ambassador nodded his head eagerly,
shoving a pad and pencil over toward the
speaker.</p>

<p>Impey took the pencil and began to write
thoughtfully. A woman&#8217;s voice came softly
intruding upon the silence of the ambassador&#8217;s
private office.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must pardon the stupidity of our
servants, Captain Inaba.&#8221; Helen&#8217;s words were
startlingly distinct, causing the ambassador to
rise quickly from his chair and Impey&#8217;s
pencil to stop suddenly and then fall upon
the desk with a sharp click, while his hand
crumpled the paper on which it had been
writing. &#8220;The idea of his not announcing
you at once; father is there in the office, I am
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey gazed wildly about him. His face
had gone quite white and the usual sang-froid
of his manner had evaporated.</p>

<p>No avenue of escape seemed possible.</p>

<p>The next moment the door was opened and
Helen&#8217;s voice announced the Japanese naval
officer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;Captain Inaba was wandering around like
a lost soul in the hall,&#8221; she exclaimed smilingly.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know our servants could be
so stupid.&#8221; She caught sight of Mr. Impey
and noticed for the first time the strained attitude
of the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, a catch in her breath.
She turned to Captain Inaba; he was standing
straight, with military precision, on the
threshold, waiting the pleasure of the ambassador
to be invited to enter. His sphinx-like
face betrayed nothing.</p>

<p>With an impatient toss of her head and a
displeased frown she quickly withdrew, walking
in stately fashion from the room.</p>

<p>In the big vestibule she discovered the two
midshipmen. They had just arrived and were
taking off their overcoats. She went quickly
to greet them, a relieved smile on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth is the matter?&#8221; she exclaimed
suddenly, for there was an atmosphere
of gloom in their solemn faces. &#8220;Tell me at
once. I am not a child to be kept in ignorance.
Is it the sailor fight in the theatre&mdash;for
I read that hours ago in the newspaper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the ambassador at home?&#8221; Phil asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
ignoring her question. His voice was anxious
and his manner studied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he is with Mr. Impey and Captain
Inaba, so you had best come with me to
the library and wait until they go,&#8221; she
replied, annoyed at the evident secrecy in
which she did not share.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey, Captain Inaba!&#8221; both midshipmen
exclaimed, casting inquiring glances
at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why not Mr. Impey and Captain
Inaba?&#8221; Helen&#8217;s voice betrayed her irritation.
&#8220;Neither one is a very dangerous person to
have in the house. You look as if you
thought they were both anarchists.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads allowed themselves to be led into
the library, while Helen sank down on the
divan, motioning them to chairs near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know the whole thing, so you
might just as well begin,&#8221; she exclaimed impatiently.
&#8220;Go on.&#8221; She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helen, there isn&#8217;t anything to tell.&#8221;
Phil had exchanged a look with his chum and
received a nod to act as spokesman. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
come to see the ambassador and ask his advice;
believe me, there is nothing to tell.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Have Mr. Impey and Captain Inaba likewise
come to ask father&#8217;s advice? How extraordinary
that all should come just at the
same time!&#8221; Her tone was sarcastic.</p>

<p>Sydney suddenly offered a weak excuse and
hastily left the two young people together.
Phil&#8217;s face showed almost a panic, but Helen
deftly placed herself between him and the
only avenue of escape.</p>

<p>The stern lines in Phil&#8217;s face had already
begun to relax. &#8220;Will you not trust me with
your secret? For I see you have one,&#8221; she
coaxed.</p>

<p>Phil shook from him his sombre humor
and a smile played about his firm mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I shall have to in the end,&#8221; he
said resignedly.</p>

<p>How clear the sky seemed now when only a
short time ago it was all clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have read the paper?&#8221; He indicated
the &#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; among other
papers on the library table. Helen nodded
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all pure fabrication,&#8221; he exclaimed
angrily. &#8220;There were no people hurt on
either side, and it is not likely to create a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
diplomatic difficulty. The officers did not
lead the sailors against the Japanese, and the
American flag was not intentionally insulted
by the Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil eagerly told the excited girl the true
story of the trouble in the theatre and its
happy outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had as much as we could do in getting
away alive,&#8221; he exclaimed enthusiastically.
&#8220;Taki&#8217;s speech spread among the crowd
like a prairie fire, and the whole town wanted
to carry us around on their shoulders. I saw
O&#8217;Neil this morning and he said the populace
manned the shafts of their rikishas and insisted
upon hauling them about town crying
&#8216;banzai America.&#8217; Our sailors were loaded
with presents, and were not allowed to even
show that they had money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad.&#8221; Helen&#8217;s face was dimpled
in smiles. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen father so worried
as when he read that account in the paper;
he tried to allay my fear by telling me that
he thought it was simply a local irritation,
but I knew he thought otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly her face clouded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why then these solemn faces when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
you arrived?&#8221; she asked abruptly. &#8220;There
must be something else!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s boyish smile had also disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is something else,&#8221; he confessed,
&#8220;and that&#8217;s what we came to see your
father about. I fear we have been placed in
a very false position, and all through my
blunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s womanly sympathies were aroused.
&#8220;Go on,&#8221; she commanded earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just how to tell you,&#8221; he began
helplessly; &#8220;it&#8217;s all so involved.&#8221; She
nodded encouragingly. He was bending forward,
his chin resting in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the motor accident yesterday the man
hurt was carrying an important secret document
belonging to the Japanese navy department.
He lost it. O&#8217;Neil and Marley, of
whom you have heard me speak, were seen, by
some of the bystanders, to pick up a letter resembling
the one lost, but it was not the same.
Last night I found this lost letter in a very
peculiar way. I put it in my pocket intending
to think over what I should do with it;
but really my mind was made up to return it
to its owners, the Japanese. Then came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
excitement in the theatre. After that we
went with Taki to the Maple Club, intending
to make ourselves presentable and return to
the ball. The secret letter was in the inside
pocket of my coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stopped, and Helen saw that his face
was drawn and worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki had told me of the loss of this letter,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;and I had promised him
that if it came into my hands I would give it to
him.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s voice was self-accusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he saw the letter in your pocket!&#8221;
she exclaimed excitedly.</p>

<p>Phil sighed. &#8220;It was worse than that. I
lost the letter, or at least it was probably
taken out of my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where? How on earth could that happen
without your knowing it?&#8221; Helen&#8217;s
eyes were opened wide in surprise. &#8220;With
your coat on and also your cape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s answer was in the
most dejected tone. &#8220;The whole way in the
motor to the club my hand was over my
pocket. I was on the point on two or three
occasions of taking the letter out and giving
it to Taki then and there. My conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
hurt me terribly, for I had given my solemn
promise and I knew I was breaking it. I told
myself I was only waiting to frame a story, for
I didn&#8217;t want to tell him then how I had
gained possession of it. When we arrived at
the club, several Japanese attendants took our
capes and caps and we went to Taki&#8217;s rooms
to tidy up. As I took off my coat I felt in
my pocket for the envelope, intending to give
it to him then. Taki had his back turned.
I saw the document was not there and what
I had supposed was it was only a fold in the
lining of my coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221; Helen asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What could I do?&#8221; Phil asked hopelessly.
&#8220;I was stupefied with surprise. Then I
thought he knew and was inwardly laughing
at me and instead of telling him of the loss, I
became sullen and resentful. Takishima&#8217;s
face was as unconcerned as ever. I knew
mine was red, for my ears burned. He appeared
to notice nothing unusual. Sydney
seemed to see that something was wrong and
blurted out, &#8216;What&#8217;s wrong, Phil?&#8217; and I
mumbled something incoherently and felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
myself becoming more confused and mortified
than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe Takishima really took the
letter?&#8221; Helen asked anxiously. Her face
showed the sympathy she felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought and thought,&#8221; Phil declared,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t make up my mind what I do
think. It may not have fallen into Japanese
hands at all, and if it has they will believe
that I have broken my word in attempting to
keep it and read it, and I had no such intentions.
The seal was broken, so they will naturally
believe that I am the guilty one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s head was bowed in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221; Helen exclaimed compassionately.
She realized that nothing could
comfort him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only knew what to do.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s tones
were almost tearful. &#8220;If I were man enough,
I&#8217;d go to Taki and tell him the whole story,
but I am not. I haven&#8217;t the nerve to acknowledge
that I didn&#8217;t play fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not run yourself down that
way, Phil,&#8221; she insisted indignantly. His
name escaped from her lips quite naturally,
and to the lad it was a soothing balm. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
don&#8217;t care what you did, you were honest.
You were going to give him the letter. How
could you know that it would be stolen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stole it from some one else.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s
voice was almost a whisper. The accompanying
silence caused him to sit erect and look
up quickly at the girl beside him. She had
recoiled, and there was an expression of horror
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stolen from some one else?&#8221; she breathed
incredulously. &#8220;How could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled at her earnestness, and Helen
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t friendly!&#8221; she exclaimed in
a hurt voice. &#8220;How can you jest when you
know how interested I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took it from some one who had obtained
it by force,&#8221; he explained quickly. &#8220;Please
do not ask me more, because that is all that I
can now tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was thoughtful, and just a shade
reserved. That she was to be excluded from
some of the secret hurt just a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now if the letter was taken from me by
either Taki or one of his people, they will
naturally think that I have had it right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
along, and that I intended keeping it,&#8221; he
said soberly. The lad&#8217;s voice was gloomier
than his words. &#8220;The best thing I can do is
to go back to the ship and stay there, and
not show myself ashore until the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;
sails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd!&#8221; Helen cried indignantly.
&#8220;You have done nothing wrong. Why should
you shoulder responsibility that does not belong
to you? You must go to Lieutenant
Takishima. I am sure that he will believe
you; tell him everything, even the name of
the person from whom you took the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the trouble. He would not believe
me when I said that I intended giving
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled bitterly as he rose to his feet.
&#8220;It&#8217;s done me a lot of good to tell you my
troubles, anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
how to thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s thoughts had gone to the dreadful
tropical island, miles away, and she saw before
her mind&#8217;s eye this mere boy who eight
months ago had gone cheerfully into the very
jaws of death in the hopes of saving another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
officer, and that officer her own brother. She
knew that her father regarded him with the
affection of a father for a son, and as Phil had
been an orphan for many years, had talked
openly to her of making him a son in fact as
well as in thought. Phil&#8217;s enthusiastic letters
from the Philippines had always fallen into
her hands after her father had read them,
and she had kept them all. To her he was
&#8220;Phil,&#8221; and she desired nothing greater than
that, conventionality being brushed aside, they
should speak as well as think of each other
by their first names.</p>

<p>Sydney suddenly returned and reported
that Impey and Inaba were about to leave,
and were approaching.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart beat wildly at Sydney&#8217;s alarming
news; he dreaded meeting this inscrutable
Japanese, whose eyes seemed to be able to
read one&#8217;s very thoughts. He had seen him
but once at short range: in the navy building
after the messenger had been carried there;
but he had taken away with him the indelible
impression of those far-seeing eyes.</p>

<p>Impey and Inaba were coming from down
the hall, the ambassador with them, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
three were strangely constrained and silent.
Their way led past the open door of the
library. Phil realized that to avoid a meeting
was impossible. Helen was already in
the doorway, and as hostess her smile was
being bestowed upon her father&#8217;s visitors. She
gave her hand to the naval officer, who bowed
low over it, striking his heels together in the
military fashion; and then she bestowed a
more intimate smile upon Robert Impey.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not polite of you,&#8221; she said to him
in mock severity, &#8220;to stay away from the ball
last night after you had asked me for two
dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey blushed in confusion, murmuring
that a sudden business call had deprived him
of the pleasure of dancing with her.</p>

<p>Helen made a sign of incredulity, and became
suddenly aware that an introduction was
necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba, I thought you had met
Mr. Perry and Mr. Monroe,&#8221; she said apologizingly.</p>

<p>All three bowed, and Phil would have
gladly welcomed an earthquake to swallow
him from sight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;I owe you an apology, Mr. Perry,&#8221; Captain
Inaba said in a low voice. The others
had walked to the far corner of the library
leaving the two alone together. &#8220;I was greatly
disturbed when I last saw you, and am afraid
I was not courteous. I have since seen your
great friend and also mine, Lieutenant Takishima,
and am sensible of the honor of having
your aid in this painful misunderstanding.
The lost letter was a great shock, but we hope
to soon regain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil dared not raise his guilty eyes. He
felt Inaba&#8217;s searching gaze upon him and
knew that the red blush of shame which was
then on his cheeks was not lost on the subtle
Japanese. Was Captain Inaba only making
sport of him? The letter was at that time
doubtless in Captain Inaba&#8217;s hands and,
what was worse, he knew that it had been
taken from Phil&#8217;s pocket!</p>

<p>Phil believed that all eyes were upon him,
for in his anxiety he had not observed that the
others had withdrawn. He felt utterly overcome
with mortification and considered
seriously running precipitously from the
room. He cudgeled his brain for something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
anything to say, to relieve the tension of the
situation. Then suddenly the apparent cruelty
of the accusing attitude of the naval officer
maddened him. He had not looked up, but he
was sure that he was frowning upon him as
the betrayer of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will find it, if you have not already,&#8221;
Phil stammered out, half in humility
and half in anger; then he raised his eyes and
saw that Captain Inaba was bowing himself
out of the room, his parchment-like face as
cold and forbidding as ever.</p>

<p>Impey remained behind, and Phil noticed
that his manner was constrained. He lingered
but a few minutes talking to the ambassador
and Helen and then left the little group of
Americans alone together.</p>

<p>The ambassador nodded to the two midshipmen
to follow him and led the way back to his
office. Helen knew intuitively that she was
not included in the invitation, and with an
impatient pout turned back into the library.</p>

<p>Mr. Tillotson seated himself at his desk and
signed to the two lads to come near him. They
saw that his face was pale, and that there were
lines under his eyes which showed plainly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
mental strain of much worry. When he spoke
his voice was low and anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are on the threshold of a national
crisis,&#8221; he said, speaking with his eyes on the
floor. &#8220;No one can be believed. My government
has entrusted to me the duty of finding
out the real intentions of Japan, and I am beset
with conflicting counsel on all sides. The
Chinese squadron is near Colombo, Ceylon, on
its way to China. Our fleet is between it and
its destination, and we must know before it is
too late whether Japan will attempt to seize
these vessels to re&euml;nforce her navy, and if so
whether her intentions are hostile. Mr. Impey
has just informed me that a paper has fallen
into his hands which divulges the secret that
Japan has determined to buy or rather seize
the ships. China has not paid for them, and
is too weak to resist the Japanese fleet. If I
could depend upon this I would cable Washington,
and our fleet is in a position to checkmate
the move. Captain Inaba then comes to
see me with apologies from the Minister of
Marine for last night&#8217;s disturbance at the
theatre. He praised our sailors highly, and
said the Emperor wished to commend our men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
for their loyalty and patriotism in saving our
flag from insult. What can one believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen shook their heads in
deep perplexity. This then was what had been
learned from the document which Phil had
found only to lose it. The midshipmen
mutually decided that what they had come to
tell the ambassador would better for the present
remain unsaid. To convince him that
Impey was a double-faced scoundrel after this
unsought confidence might be difficult. That
must wait a more opportune time.</p>

<small>MORE DISCOVERIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span> and Marley decided that they had
best leave Tokyo for the present. Their uniforms,
which had been neat and trim when
they arrived, were now in the bright light of
morning in a deplorable state, torn and
stained with dirt from their struggle in the
theatre the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are certainly hard-looking citizens,
Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil remarked sadly as they rapidly
clothed themselves in their tattered remnants,
&#8220;and a whole day more leave to our credit,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both sailors knew their first duty was to
give to the midshipmen the information
which they had been directed to get from the
injured messenger, and this duty was now all
the more urgent, for O&#8217;Neil carried within
his torn uniform blouse the much sought
document itself.</p>

<p>He had picked it up on the stage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
theatre. At the hotel they were told that the
midshipmen had gone, and believing they had
returned to the &#8220;Alaska,&#8221; they were just in
time to catch a fast train for Yokohama.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, how would you like to fight these
little Japs, eh? It wasn&#8217;t such hard work
last night, was it?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Bill answered conditionally. &#8220;They
had a look in their eyes, though, that wasn&#8217;t
no way pleasant. It seemed to tell you: &#8216;Go
ahead and down me; there&#8217;s lots more anxious
to take my place.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil smiled grimly.
&#8220;They&#8217;re fatalists; it ain&#8217;t nothing for them
to die, no more than for you to get a tooth
pulled. When a man is killed in battle here
his family have a big celebration and invite
all their friends in to help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they got as good ships as ours?&#8221;
Marley questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you ever been on board a Jap battle-ship?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked in surprise. Marley
shook his head. &#8220;Well, the next time we go
ashore we&#8217;ll go down to the dockyard at
Yokoska. They are mighty perticular, but
I reckon we can get tickets through that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Jap officer friend of Mr. Perry&#8217;s. But mind,
Bill, you don&#8217;t let your fishy eyes rest too long
on anything you see, and leave your kodak
on board ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley&#8217;s face wore a disgusted and pained
expression. &#8220;You know, Jack, that I ain&#8217;t
none of these long-haired, mushroom sailors
with a &#8216;snap me quick&#8217; over his shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil laughed loudly. The idea was
amusing. Then he caught sight of a familiar
figure, just passing their compartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, you old parchment-faced pirate,&#8221;
he called, and Sago, the Japanese steward, entered
bowing and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you mean by taking us into
that hornet&#8217;s nest last night?&#8221; the sailor continued
banteringly. &#8220;You might have known
my friend Bill here would have &#8216;started
something&#8217;; he usually does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley let the remark go. He was ever a
lap or two behind Jack O&#8217;Neil in his train of
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, could you recognize again the fellow
who carried the flag?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil suddenly asked.
&#8220;If we could lay our hands on that gentleman
we might find out something useful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Did you hear Mr. Perry tell us that he and
the little Jap lieutenant believe it was a fixed
up game to start a row with our men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all too mixed for me. I can unmoor
ship from an elbow or a cross, but when my
cables are all tangled up in knots, then I am
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley had lapsed into a sailor metaphor
indicating that the devious ways of diplomatic
intrigue were beyond his simple comprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sago, what does your methodical brain
tell you is the real game being played here in
Japan?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil directed his eloquence upon
the silently complacent steward. &#8220;Do these
one time countrymen of yours want to annex
the United States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Sago was emphatic in his negative.
&#8220;Japanee very funny, all time want to learn
something. American they don&#8217;t understand.
They think Japanee very curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Sago,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil turned on him suddenly,
and the little old man started in mild
surprise, &#8220;suppose we had a war with Japan.
What would you do? Skip back here and
go in the Jap navy?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Sago was indignant. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ever fight
against the United States,&#8221; he declared positively.
&#8220;Sago think Japan no want to fight.
Plenty soldiers and sailors, but no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike me blind, if there ain&#8217;t that yellow
villain what carried the flag.&#8221; Marley was
half out of his seat, his eyes staring at what
appeared to be a Japanese servant by his dark
blue livery. In his hands were several
valises, and in front of him, just entering a
compartment in the same car as our friends,
were two Europeans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend Randall,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
as he laid a detaining arm about Marley&#8217;s
waist. &#8220;Hold fast, Bill, there may be something
in this. Just sit tight and wait. They
ain&#8217;t going to get away until we reach Yokohama,
because this is an express.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got that paper there, Jack?&#8221;
Marley asked as he saw O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s hand down
inside his blouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s safe anchored here,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied,
&#8220;and I can&#8217;t keep my hands off it. I&#8217;ll
bet a month&#8217;s pay it&#8217;s the same one that little
Jap messenger lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sailors had examined it the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
before in their room by the faint light of a
Japanese dip and the markings were the same
as that described by Oka.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil drew a letter stealthily from his
pocket, while Marley put his back against the
door to ward off interruptions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us the dope of this in United States,
Sago,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil ordered as he held out the
official document to the awe-struck steward.
Sago&#8217;s eyes were as big as saucers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you get him?&#8221; the Japanese asked,
making a quick grab for the letter and in his
excitement forgetting to speak good English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belay there!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried angrily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold it right here and you can read it
backward<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This very serious,&#8221; Sago exclaimed fearfully.
&#8220;If some one see us we all go to
Japanese jail. That Emperor&#8217;s letter. More
better you take quick back to Tokyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life. I am going to know
what these officers were so anxious about,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil declared while Marley wagged his
head in confirmation of his chum&#8217;s sentiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
&#8220;If you&#8217;re as good an American as you try
to make us believe you are, you&#8217;d read it
instead of trembling there like a Chinaman
about to get his head chopped off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago read the letter slowly to himself.
After his first surprise his natural sagacity
asserted itself. He knew that the real contents
of this letter should not be told the
sailors. He trembled at the thought of knowing
it himself. He must satisfy these two
determined men and then endeavor to get
the letter into his captain&#8217;s hands. Sago
saw that a military secret had been taken
from a nation which prided itself upon its
power to keep such secrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;That say nothing.&#8221; Sago had expelled the
anxiety from his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It says that next month Japanese navy
will have very big drills and that all ships
will be present to be reviewed by the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago looked up, his face now quite composed.
&#8220;There is plenty more, but all orders
of the admiral what each ship is to do.&#8221;
Sago had made this up quickly and O&#8217;Neil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and Marley saw no reason to doubt the
honesty of his translation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known that was all there was to it,
I wouldn&#8217;t have taken the trouble of throttling
that little Jap for it last night,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed in disgust. &#8220;I&#8217;d let him have it,
for I suppose that&#8217;s what he was after when
he was hunting through my clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; Sago asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that joint of a hotel where Bill and
I put up. They searched our room while we
was asleep, but this was next to me under my
shirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago looked worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you get him?&#8221; he asked excitedly,
touching the letter with his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it on the stage of that theatre
after the row last night,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neil placidly.
&#8220;I was goin&#8217; to hand it to Mr. Perry, but he got
away before I could slip it to him on the quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had made up his mind to know
more of the movements of Randall, and with
this intention in mind he placed himself deliberately
in his path on the station platform
when the train had arrived at Yokohama, a
good-natured smile on his Irish face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Randall appeared nervously apprehensive
as he gazed about him, while his older companion
and the half-breed servant hurried
ahead in the direction of the entrance to the
station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going away?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked shortly, falling
into step at Randall&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking a little trip for my health,&#8221; was
the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil insisted.</p>

<p>Randall turned upon him, an angry frown
on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see, stranger, as that&#8217;s any of your
concern,&#8221; he replied shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a little friendly question, Mr. Randall,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said evenly. &#8220;May I inquire if
Mr. Impey is going with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall&#8217;s face turned suddenly pale, and
the hand holding the morning paper shook
perceptibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know entirely too much,&#8221; he cried
unguardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, &#8220;and the
yellow boy there off the stage. I see he&#8217;s in
the party too, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall had stepped between the shafts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
a rikisha into which he was about to enter,
with one foot on the step.</p>

<p>After all, what had he to fear from this
American sailor? The jig was up, and perhaps
he could be made useful. Why then
make an enemy of him?</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to the English Hatoba,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he
replied quickly; &#8220;meet us there and I&#8217;ll answer
your questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>When O&#8217;Neil and Marley arrived at the
landing Randall and his friends were already
in a little naphtha launch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in,&#8221; Randall invited.</p>

<p>The sailors waved good-bye to Sago, who
was waiting for the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; steamer,
and were soon alongside a trim little sea-going
yacht anchored just inside the breakwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t my flag,&#8221; Randall exclaimed in
a relieved voice as he stepped over the side,
and pointing to the British ensign at the
yacht&#8217;s gaff, &#8220;but it gives me a nice comfortable
feeling of security. I have been
jumping at my shadow for the last six
months.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Randall led the way into the forward cabin.
After the two Americans were seated he surveyed
them for several minutes in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about me and Mr.
Impey?&#8221; he asked finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill and I saw you go away with him in
his motor yesterday after you left us at Billy
Williams&#8217;,&#8221; the sailor answered, &#8220;after telling
us that you didn&#8217;t know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t tell all I know to every chance
acquaintance,&#8221; Randall returned; &#8220;but now
as it&#8217;s all over with us I don&#8217;t mind answering
your question. Mr. Impey owns this
yacht, and is taking Mr. Wells and me for a
little trip for our health.&#8221; Randall wore a
good-natured grin upon his face as he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey found a very important letter
yesterday, or at least Wells found it and gave
it to him, and then he got robbed and was left
senseless in his house last night after he had
broken the seal and read it. That&#8217;s why we
are changing our climate. Japan is getting a
little too hot for our comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of looking letter was it?&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil asked seriously, his hand in his blouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
where the Japanese document was concealed.
&#8220;Was it in English?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, in Japanese, of course, and sealed
with the big red seal of the Mikado,&#8221; Randall
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who read it?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked. &#8220;I thought
you said it was in Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did. Mr. Impey read it. He knows
their fly tracks by heart; he&#8217;s a wizard on Oriental
languages,&#8221; Randall answered quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did your letter say?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked
earnestly. His fingers had closed upon the
one hidden in his blouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know all, but something about
seizing or buying the Chinese battle-ships;
also a lot of talk about what the United States
was doing&mdash;most of it untrue and furnished
by Impey and company, that&#8217;s us, you know,&#8221;
including himself and Wells in a sweep of his
hand. Then Randall&#8217;s eye fell upon the letter
which O&#8217;Neil had drawn forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; Randall had jumped to his
feet and was hugging the astonished sailor.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the very letter. Impey thought the
Japs had taken it, and we were all &#8216;beating
it&#8217; in the yacht.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice was sarcastic, &#8220;some
one&#8217;s been stringing you. This letter talks
about a naval review of the fleet by the Emperor
and a lot of other unimportant stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Randall&#8217;s turn to be sarcastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve translated it offhand
yourself?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;or maybe your friend
there has an intimate knowledge of Japanese
classics. He looks like a scholar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your high-brow jaw!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
eyes flashed; he could chaff his friend if he
liked, but he resented it from a stranger.
&#8220;It was read to us by a Jap steward from the
&#8216;Alaska.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he did it intentionally. He was
probably afraid to tell you what was really in
it. But where and how did you get it?&#8221; Randall
asked. Then he turned and cried aloud
up the hatch to Wells who had gone to meet
a boat that had come alongside, &#8220;Say, Jim,
here&#8217;s the lost letter, snug enough, in this
sailor&#8217;s hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil explained how he had obtained it.
Randall shook his head in sign of mystery.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_188.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THIS LETTER TALKS<br />
ABOUT A NAVAL REVIEW&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It beats me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how it got to the
theatre. I witnessed the theatre row and afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
found Mr. Impey knocked out on the
floor of his room; both happened about the
same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim lost a paper in the crowd when the
man was run over,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and one of
your officers picked this up near the wheels
of the motor, and Wells took it thinking it was
the one he had lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you fellows are the authors of that pack
of lies about our ship? Bill there got your
yellow journal dope for the Jap newspaper.&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s face was black with anger; he saw it
all now. These were the men who had
aroused the Japanese nation, who had embittered
them against everything American.
&#8220;And you call yourself an American, too!&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s fists were clenched tightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
good mind to give you a good thrashing here
and now,&#8221; he cried, advancing menacingly
upon the surprised journalist.</p>

<p>Randall was between the two threatening
sailors and the hatchway, with the heavy
mahogany table between. He put up his
hands as if he would appease the two angry
sailors, and then with the agility of a cat
cleared the ladder in one bound, and the surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
sailors heard the iron hatch above them
close shut with a loud report. They rushed
madly up the ladder and with their combined
strength attempted to force the steel door, but
it withstood their combined attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shanghai&#8217;d, by Jove!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice
was tearful with anger.</p>

<p>A tramping of feet overhead and the sound
of hurried orders given in a loud voice, then
a clanking of chain, came to their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said sadly, &#8220;and
just when things was about to get interesting.
We&#8217;re playing in hard luck, sure.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>CAPTAIN INABA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sago</span> watched the two sailors step into the
naphtha launch with their new-found friends
and go swiftly out to a little black yacht
anchored just inside the long breakwater. He
waited until it was evident that the sailors
had gone up the gangway ladder and were
aboard, and there was a puzzled look on the
face of the Japanese. He stood for several
seconds, his eyes on the yacht, and then finally
walked quickly away.</p>

<p>The steam launch from the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; came
alongside just as he turned, and its coxswain
hailed him. &#8220;Going off to the ship, Sago?&#8221;
But Sago did not hear, or if he heard he made
no answer, nor did he slacken his pace. At
the end of the dock he stepped into a rikisha
and at full speed the little vehicle rushed
toward the Yokohama railroad station.</p>

<p>An hour later Captain Inaba was in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
office at the navy department. His bronze
face wore a worried look. From his secret
service men, who had been detailed to trace
down the missing documents, very baffling
news had come. Two of his men had had the
letter in their grasp only to lose it. The
quarters in the Imperial Hotel had been
thoroughly searched, but it had not been found,
yet he was confident that it was in American
hands. An official-appearing letter addressed
to the editor of the &#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; was found
in Midshipman Perry&#8217;s valise at the hotel.
Inaba still held this letter on his desk awaiting
Takishima&#8217;s arrival to help translate its
contents, for nothing must interfere with
tracing down the important paper. His reputation,
even his life, depended upon keeping
the contents of the lost letter secret from the
Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one to see me, and from the American
war-ship!&#8221; the little naval man exclaimed,
as an attendant delivered a message,
holding the door open. &#8220;Let him enter at
once.&#8221; Inaba arose from his chair excitedly,
and took several steps in the messenger&#8217;s
direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Sago came hesitatingly into the room. The
American steward had not forgotten his early
training, and when he beheld the important
official, he stopped and made several low
obeisances, drawing in his breath each time
between closed teeth.</p>

<p>Sago was now essentially a Japanese. His
fifteen years in the United States navy had
quite passed from his mind. The oath he
had taken to uphold the honor of his adopted
country was forgotten. Those few silent minutes&#8217;
struggle on the dock while he had
watched the launch, knowing that the sacred
seal of the Emperor had been violated and
the letter polluted by alien hands, had proved
to him that his allegiance yet belonged to his
Emperor and Japan.</p>

<p>Inaba gazed in surprise at this fellow
countryman in an American steward&#8217;s uniform.
He knew of course that there were
many of his people so employed, but there
was something singularly familiar about this
man&#8217;s face. Sago kept his eyes lowered, and
his head hung down in sign of humility before
this powerful adviser to the Minister of
Marine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;What is it? Speak, man!&#8221; Inaba commanded.</p>

<p>Sago looked guardedly around the office,
assuring himself there were no other ears but
his and his questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your augustness,&#8221; Sago began meekly,
bowing again and sucking in his breath, &#8220;I
have at last found great joy in being able to
help my country. Years ago I wronged her,
and have paid dearly for it by my self-inflicted
exile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inaba approached close to the humble and
penitent man and gazed long into his averted
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am waiting,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Your
face comes back to me out of the dim past,
but I know you not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember Raku? He who allowed
the war plans to be stolen, and who
fled rather than face the disgrace, and who
was too cowardly to take his own worthless
life in atonement?&#8221; Sago raised his eyes
and for a second dared to look into Inaba&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have been all these years in
exile?&#8221; Inaba asked kindly, his voice low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
thrilled with wonder. &#8220;Did you not hear
that the plans were not stolen? The thieves
carried away nothing valuable. The plans
had been removed the night before by the
Minister of Marine himself, and placed in a
safer vault. Those very plans were used successfully
in our late war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago&#8217;s care-worn, wizened face broke into
lines of joy, and into his eyes tears rushed
unbidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;My guilt was no less, augustness. I slept
when I should have been watching,&#8221; he said
penitently. &#8220;And for this I gave up my
country and the companionship of my blood
and have lived among aliens. They have
always been kind, and I love them next to
my own people. Augustness, then you were
a mere stripling in the office of the minister;
now you have become the giant oak upon
whom the nation leans for support. Your
brain is the oracle on naval tactics and
strategy; where before you followed, now you
lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inaba smiled, and in his eyes there was a
look of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raku, I am but the clay in the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the sculptor. All my achievements have been
possible only through the virtue of His Majesty,
our Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men bowed almost to the ground as
the magic words were spoken.</p>

<p>Sago drew nearer and spoke quickly and
earnestly while Inaba listened, his anxious
face becoming more tranquil as the minutes
went by. There was no interruption.</p>

<p>After Sago had finished, Inaba sat for
several minutes in profound thought. This
indeed was startling and baffling news. The
letter in the hands of American sailors and on
board Mr. Impey&#8217;s yacht. Impey he had
seen scarcely two hours ago. He had seen
him go into the American Embassy and had
followed him in, as he himself had business
with the ambassador. For some time he had
mistrusted this smooth foreigner and his intimate
relations with the American ambassador.
If by ill fortune the ambassador&#8217;s daughter
had not interrupted him after he had dismissed
the servant, he might have surprised
the conversation on the other side of the
closed door to the ambassador&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>When he had entered he felt a delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
situation had arisen, but his own confusion
in being surprised had made it impossible
for him to analyze the causes. Had Impey
then given the ambassador the contents of
this important letter? His spies had told him
that Impey had held the letter; but why
should he divulge it to the American ambassador?
Sago stood silently watching the
sphinx-like face which betrayed nothing of
the methodical reasoning within Inaba&#8217;s
mind. Then the naval man nodded and
smiled, patting the steward on the back as
one would reward a child for a favor done.</p>

<p>The cable was his first thought. In answer
to a bell several underlings quietly
appeared. Inaba wrote hastily, sealed the
letter, and a messenger quickly departed. No
cable messages would leave the country until
censored by Inaba. That order he had given
by a stroke of the pen. The knowledge of
the contents of the last letter would remain in
Japan until the time had passed when it could
do harm. The next letter was quickly despatched.
It would prevent the British yacht
&#8220;Sylvia&#8221; from leaving Yokohama harbor
until he, Inaba, authorized its release.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
&#8220;Raku, our Emperor does not forget the
faithful,&#8221; Inaba said after he had finished his
writing. &#8220;Remain true to your conscience
and the honor of your ancestors.&#8221; Sago withdrew,
a grateful look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then Inaba drew out from a drawer in his
desk the letter found the night before in the
American midshipmen&#8217;s room. His knowledge
of English writing was not great, but as
Takishima had not put in an appearance, he
read on slowly, laboriously, seeking words
frequently in a dictionary at his side. The
situation had become more perplexing. Here
was an article calculated to arouse the Japanese
people against the American naval
visitors, written in English and intended for
a newspaper supposedly owned by a foreign
syndicate. Takishima had brought him the
word the night before that the midshipman
had denied that the lost letter had been found
by their sailors, and Takishima was quite
confident that his classmate was honorable.
Yet here was a letter found in his room which
showed conclusively that he was not honorable.</p>

<p>And then came Sago&#8217;s information that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the American sailors held the lost letter and
had even asked him to translate it. Inaba
felt that a great crisis had been reached. It
was apparent to him that America was endeavoring
to force a crisis on Japan through
this visit of the &#8220;Alaska.&#8221; When this decision
was reached the long projected and
assiduously studied plans should immediately
be put in operation. Then Japan would
stand ready on guard, but would not strike
the first blow unless her honor demanded it.</p>

<p>Inaba sat at his desk deep in thought. His
dreams of a great war with a power worthy
of his country&#8217;s steel made his blood quicken.
From the battle between two such fleets as
America and Japan would pit against each
other, many naval lessons yet unlearned, even
as yet unthought, would be demonstrated. It
would be a fight that would stand out in
raised letters on the pages of the world&#8217;s history,
and he would be the man to whom
future naval historians would give credit for
the wonderful victory on the seas won by the
Japanese fleet, for Captain Inaba was certain
of success. It would be due of course entirely
to the great virtue of his Emperor. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Japanese would understand that, but the
foreigners would lay it to the work of his
methodical and far-seeing brain. A messenger
had silently entered and spoke a few
words in a low voice; scarcely hearing, Inaba
had nodded, still deep in his revery. Then
across his mental vision flashed a face and
Impey stood before him&mdash;nervously smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was the unconscious means of losing a
valuable letter, Captain Inaba.&#8221; Impey&#8217;s
manner was hasty and he talked as one not sure
of his ground. The steely eyes of the Japanese
gazed out on him uncompromisingly.
His parchment-colored face was expressionless.
&#8220;Fortunately I have been enabled to secure
this letter, and it is now safe on board the
yacht &#8216;Sylvia.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Inaba&#8217;s face did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I had already learned so, Mr.
Impey, and had given orders to prevent her
sailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s face was a picture of confusion and
embarrassment. This little Japanese he had
always feared, attributing to him powers more
than human. He knew that Inaba suspected
him, and that the two men who had assaulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
him in his own rooms were Inaba&#8217;s men. He
then must know that the letter had been in
his hands. The sailors had taken it from one
of these men before he could deliver it to Captain
Inaba. Impey knew nothing of Phil&#8217;s
interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter came into my hands, its seal
broken,&#8221; he said nervously. &#8220;It was taken
from me at my home, and not until this morning
did I find out who had caused it to be impossible
to return the letter to you as I intended.&#8221;
Impey&#8217;s courage slowly returned as
he hastily explained while Inaba&#8217;s cold eyes
looked on unmoved. &#8220;The sailors showed
the letter to two of my friends, and they contrived
to get them on board my yacht where
they are now under lock and key, awaiting
your pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then so far the secret is safe,&#8221; Captain
Inaba replied. His voice showed relief. &#8220;The
Americans could hardly have had it translated
so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a Japanese on board the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;;
he is Captain Rodgers&#8217; steward,&#8221; Impey interjected.
&#8220;He would be able to read the letter
if there had been time. One of my friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
said the steward was on the train with the
sailors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Inaba smiled. He knew that Raku
could be trusted. Then if Impey had not
translated it the secret was as yet safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can translate our language, Mr.
Impey?&#8221; Captain Inaba questioned quietly.
&#8220;If the secret then is out, you naturally fall
under suspicion. The letter was in regard to
the ships our Emperor has considered buying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey raised his hand to his throat, something
seemed choking him, before he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not read the letter,&#8221; he said in a
frightened voice. &#8220;The seal was broken when
it came to me. Why should I wish to inform
the Americans of a secret which I have been
as anxious as yourself to keep? You must
remember, Captain Inaba,&#8221; he went on with
attempted dignity, &#8220;that it is merely a business
affair with me. As agent I have
agreed to sell you these ships at a price
stipulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inaba&#8217;s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure, Mr. Impey,&#8221; he asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
coldly, &#8220;that you have not two strings to your
bow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey paled as he heard the words and
wished he had remained on board his yacht,
instead of trusting himself back in Tokyo.
He had risked much in this return; but this
he was willing to do if he could be sure of
preventing the reception of the American captain
by the Emperor. This meeting Impey
feared. He had heard of the letter written by
the President of the United States, and believed
that if this letter was read by the
Mikado that Japan would decide not to buy
the Chinese ships, thereby making his work
of a year profitless.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the secret being in the hands of the
Americans, I cannot say,&#8221; Impey said quickly,
appearing not to have considered Captain
Inaba&#8217;s accusation of duplicity. &#8220;The letter
was in the keeping of the Americans all night.
It has been through many hands. I took it
from the midshipmen while they were dressing
for the reception at the prime minister&#8217;s.&#8221;
This Impey decided to say, although it was
untrue, hoping that Captain Inaba&#8217;s suspicions
might be diverted from himself to the Americans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
He in truth had obtained the letter
from Wells and had but finished its translation
when the two Japanese detectives interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sailors,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;appear to have
trailed it down and eventually, as you know,
succeeded in recovering it. The American
ambassador sent for me early this morning to
talk with me in regard to the concession for
the Kiangsu-Hohan Railway in which my
syndicate is interested. I noticed that he was
strangely excited and when you entered his
office I believe he was on the point of telling
me the cause of his agitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Impey was speaking a messenger
quietly entered the office, handing Captain
Inaba an envelope which he eagerly opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ambassador has our secret,&#8221; the naval
officer exclaimed. &#8220;Here are his cipher cables
to Washington and Manila. They must contain
the secret. The code is too difficult for
us to translate, so I must act as if the letter
had been read by the Americans. All cables
by my orders are being held up by the cable
operators until it is too late for them to harm
us. That we are determined to secure at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
once the ships of the new China navy will
not be known by the United States government
until the ships are in our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The turn affairs had taken was a great
blow to Impey. His single aim, for which
he had even risked his life, for he feared a
fanatic&#8217;s knife if his duplicity was made
public, was that the United States should be
forced to seize the Chinese ships. Everything
had been designed to lead up to this crowning
event.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you seize the ships at once?&#8221;
Impey exclaimed, striving to inject a gladness
into his voice which he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>The presence of the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; came suddenly
into Impey&#8217;s mind. She could not be
stopped, and once away could send the secret
by wireless to Guam, Honolulu, and thence to
the United States. So after all his cause was
not entirely lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall advise sailing at once to intercept
the Chinese squadron,&#8221; Captain Inaba answered
promptly. &#8220;Have you the release from
the Wai-Wu-Pu ready&mdash;for we do not wish to
appear to seize the ships?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has not come from Peking,&#8221; Impey replied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
&#8220;It was not thought that such haste
would be necessary. I expect it in a few
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall proceed without it,&#8221; Captain
Inaba exclaimed. &#8220;The Chinese admiral
will hardly risk a fight against our
formidable fleet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey had quite regained his natural
humor. He had been given a severe fright,
but he thought Captain Inaba&#8217;s suspicions
toward himself had been successfully allayed.</p>

<p>The yacht was ready to sail, and the permit
from the Wai-Wu-Pu, the throne council
of China, for the United States to take the
entire new navy from the Chinese crews was
in Impey&#8217;s possession at that moment. The
&#8220;Alaska&#8221; could sail from Yokohama, and
send the important news of Japan&#8217;s intentions
of seizing the Chinese ships. The yacht with
her high speed could carry ahead the permit
to the United States admiral in Manila Bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Japan is indeed fortunate, Captain Inaba,
in the possession of an officer who so successfully
combines the qualities of a strategist,
diplomat and international detective. I take
off my hat to you, sir.&#8221; Impey pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
his words with great precision. No sign of
the nervousness which earlier had been apparent
was evident.</p>

<p>He was as yet safe from Captain Inaba&#8217;s
suspicion. With that thought bringing a
smile to his lips he bowed himself out of the
office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>PHIL CONFESSES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen were much agitated over
the exciting news of the contemplated seizure
of the Chinese ships by Japan given them by
the ambassador. Where could Impey have
obtained his information?</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we depend upon the truth of this
story?&#8221; Phil asked anxiously as the two
lads left the embassy to return to their hotel.</p>

<p>Sydney shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If what we&#8217;ve heard was in the secret
letter then there&#8217;s no way to prove its truth,&#8221;
he answered thoughtfully, &#8220;for now the letter
is back in the hands of the Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is what was in the letter, then the
seal had been broken by Impey and the
Japanese will believe that we are the guilty
ones,&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;That will make
them even more determined to seize the
Chinese ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were more than ever suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of Impey&#8217;s honesty. What was his
part in this international intrigue? What
was Impey&#8217;s object? Why had he talked to
them at the garden f&ecirc;te in the same strain as
he had talked to the Japanese baron in the
railroad train?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found out who the baron is, Syd,&#8221;
Phil added. &#8220;His name is Kosuba, and he is
president of the &#8216;Koko Kisen&#8217; steamship
line, the largest in Japan. They own over
two hundred steamers. It&#8217;s quite natural that
he should want a big navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very strange,&#8221; Sydney replied thoughtfully.
&#8220;Impey persuades him that Japan
must at once buy the Chinese squadron to
prevent our getting it and goes to our ambassador
the next day with the news that
Japan has decided to buy or seize them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the time,&#8221; Phil returned angrily,
&#8220;the United States is not giving a thought
to the Chinese ships. No one can purchase
ships without money, and Congress has not
appropriated money for this purpose, and
probably has no thought of so doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire affair puzzled the two midshipmen
greatly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>&#8220;I suppose the ambassador will send a
cable to Washington giving Impey&#8217;s information,&#8221;
Sydney said as they walked toward
the hotel to dress themselves appropriately
for the Japanese dinner to be given them by
Takishima and his sister at their own house.</p>

<p>&#8220;He believes implicitly in Impey,&#8221; Phil
replied impatiently. &#8220;I had it in mind two
or three times to break in and give him the
benefit of my experience with that individual,
but I saw it would be quite useless. The
affair of last night, when I found him being
assaulted by two secret service men for possession
of the paper, is the one thing that I
cannot explain,&#8221; he added. &#8220;That would
convince the ambassador of his fidelity to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can we find Captain Rodgers?&#8221;
Sydney suddenly asked. &#8220;He must be told
the entire story. This is the day he is to be
received in audience by the Emperor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded his head; but secretly he did
not relish this duty. His conscience pricked
him for having foolishly held the document
for even an instant. His proper course would
have been to have given Takishima the letter
when they met in the road after the fight at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Impey&#8217;s and there told him where he had
found it and the circumstances. That might
have seemed the logical thing to do, but after
his fight with two policemen it was not likely
the youngster would confess his guilt so
readily.</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers was in his room at the
hotel when the midshipmen returned. He
was much perturbed over the non-arrival of
his steward, who had been sent to the ship
for some of his uniforms; fortunately the
executive officer had sent his valises.</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers saw in the faces of the
lads that something serious had occurred,
and questioned them in open alarm.</p>

<p>Phil undertook the ordeal manfully but
with much embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just come from the embassy,&#8221; he
began, striving to speak calmly, &#8220;and the
ambassador has information that Japan will
surely intercept and take possession of the
Chinese squadron.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers&#8217; face showed the effect of
these words. &#8220;The ambassador has information!&#8221;
he exclaimed excitedly. &#8220;From whom
did he get it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;From a man by the name of Impey. He
was at the garden f&ecirc;te yesterday,&#8221; Phil answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I remember him,&#8221; Captain
Rodgers returned. &#8220;Who in thunder is he,
and how does he come to get such information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know very little about him, sir, but I
can tell you some things that may help to
show whether the information is true or not,&#8221;
Phil mustered up courage to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down.&#8221; The captain waved his hand
to chairs, but Phil preferred to remain standing.
Where to begin was the lad&#8217;s difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday on the train, Mr. Winston, Mr.
Monroe and I overheard this man Impey tell
the president of the Koko Kisen Steamship
Company that he knew the United States
had made up its mind to seize the Chinese
squadron, and insinuated that our visit here
was only a blind to conceal the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scoundrel,&#8221; Captain Rodgers cried
angrily. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a word of truth in it;
but my audience with the Mikado will change
the complexion of everything. Go on!&#8221; he
added eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;Since then we have tried to watch this
Mr. Impey and find out something about
him, but have had but little luck.&#8221; Phil
approached his confession with marked hesitancy,
and Captain Rodgers showed plainly
his impatience to learn what the youngster
had to tell him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the garden f&ecirc;te yesterday, Mr. Monroe
and I came away in Mr. Impey&#8217;s motor car.&#8221;
Phil saw the impatience in his captain&#8217;s face
and decided to take the plunge. &#8220;Unfortunately,
we ran over a Japanese messenger
carrying an official letter from the navy department.
The messenger was severely hurt
and his letter lost. Later, during the ball at
the prime minister&#8217;s, Lieutenant Takishima,
hearing of a disturbance in a local theatre in
which our sailors were involved, led us there.
I became separated from Takishima and Sydney
on the way, and by the merest accident
I was able to save Mr. Impey from the assault
of two Japanese who I thought were robbing
him. It turned out they had traced the missing
letter to his door and were bent upon
regaining it. After rendering the two assailants
unconscious, I took the letter from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
hand of one of them and put it in my coat
pocket, and then hurried away to join the
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this letter?&#8221; Captain Rodgers
exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I intended giving it to Takishima, for I
felt that I had no right to it even though it
might hold information useful to the United
States,&#8221; Phil stammered, &#8220;but it was again
taken or dropped from my pocket. I didn&#8217;t
miss it until we arrived at the Maple Club,
after smoothing out the difficulty at the
theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain had not read the morning papers,
so Phil explained the theatre episode to
him and the part Takishima had played.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Lieutenant Takishima also believes
that the flag episode was arranged by some
one for the purpose of starting this unpleasant
encounter?&#8221; the captain asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that&#8217;s what he said, and our men
are sure that the man with the flag was not a
Japanese. Marley said his eyes were round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could he have been a Filipino?&#8221; Captain
Rodgers questioned thoughtfully. &#8220;There
are many Filipinos in the East, who have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
discredited in Manila and are quite willing to
do anything to injure the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter,&#8221; Phil wished to clear his mind
of the fateful document, &#8220;was in Mr. Impey&#8217;s
hands long enough for him to obtain from it
the information he has given our ambassador.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say it was taken again from you and
perhaps by the Japanese?&#8221; Captain Rodgers
asked, for he was just beginning to understand
the seriousness of the situation. &#8220;Then
they will know that the letter has been
opened and read, if it has been, and having
found it in your pocket will naturally suspect
you of having opened it and read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could only nod his head in mortified
silence. How much more culpable it sounded
in the voice of his captain!</p>

<p>&#8220;And further,&#8221; Captain Rodgers&#8217; tones
were cold and accusing, &#8220;as I have brought
you to Tokyo as my aides, the officials will
suspect me of using you to spy upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The awkward situation came to the American
captain&#8217;s mind in forceful colors.
Through this unfortunate occurrence his
peaceful mission to Japan might be a complete
failure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;When you found the letter was missing
what did you do? Have you confided in
your classmate Takishima?&#8221; The captain&#8217;s
voice was anxious, but Phil&#8217;s silent negative
showed him this hope of clearing up the matter
was futile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then unquestioningly they believe your
intention was to hold this document, even
though you had not opened it,&#8221; he added in
severe tones. &#8220;Your actions bear out this
assumption. The Japanese authorities will
know by now that you attacked their agents
and took the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stood abashed before his captain. The
situation was even more serious than he had
supposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, sir,&#8221; he said humbly. &#8220;I
know that I acted ill advisedly, but how was I
to know that the letter would be taken from
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use crying over spilt milk,&#8221;
Captain Rodgers rejoined more kindly.
&#8220;What we must think of is how we are to
counteract this bad impression.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face showed a sudden gleam of happiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;I am willing to do anything, sir,&#8221; the lad
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if you should go to your classmate
Takishima, and explain to him as you have
to me?&#8221; Captain Rodgers asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so at once, sir, if you believe
that is the best way,&#8221; Phil replied quickly.
He very much disliked the task, for he knew
that Takishima would question his honest intentions.
He would wonder why he had not
immediately returned the letter, and why he
had said nothing of it until it had passed beyond
his control.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an appointment to pay my respects
to the Emperor in a few hours,&#8221; Captain
Rodgers replied anxiously. &#8220;If my meeting
is a success, I hope all misunderstandings will
be over. But if this meeting should be
stopped now at the last minute, the effect
would be very bad. All eyes in America are
turned to this audience. It has been noised
abroad that I am the bearer of a personal letter
from our President to the Mikado, and the
denial of an audience would be taken by our
countrymen at large to mean that Japan is unwilling
to meet us amicably.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Phil felt that the whole responsibility rested
upon his shoulders. His blunder might readily
be the cause of the catastrophe outlined by
Captain Rodgers. The captain did not deny
the existence of such a letter and had intimated
that if the audience could be held, all
misunderstandings would cease to exist; so
undoubtedly there was such a letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ambassador has sent for me, and I am
now going to the embassy,&#8221; the captain continued.
He was dressed in his special full
dress uniform, worn only on state occasions
when crowned heads and presidents were to
be visited. &#8220;It must be to talk over the
situation. He is much worried. I can&#8217;t
imagine what has happened to Sago,&#8221; he
added irritably. &#8220;He was to have been here
nearly an hour ago with my valises, but the
valises arrived and no Sago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was with our sailors last night,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, &#8220;and afterward Mr. Monroe and I
met him in the corridor of the hotel. It was
he that telephoned to a police station near the
prime minister&#8217;s house and in that way we
heard promptly of the disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for Sago,&#8221; Captain Rodgers exclaimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
&#8220;I really believe he is thoroughly
loyal to us. He has been my steward for over
five years, and I have implicit trust in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A servant knocked on the door announcing
the carriage, and Captain Rodgers made
ready to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t anticipate trouble, but make a
point of telling your classmate Takishima the
whole story. Don&#8217;t allow him to harbor a
single suspicion of the visit of the &#8216;Alaska.&#8217;
By the way,&#8221; the captain stopped at the doorway,
&#8220;I hear from the ambassador that the
&#8216;Shimbunshi,&#8217; a Tokyo newspaper, has been
attributing all manner of motives to our
visit, in fact, going quite as far as to claim
that we are here to precipitate war. They
bring up the visit of the &#8216;Maine&#8217; to Havana
before our war with Spain as an example.
Was there anything more in this morning&#8217;s
edition?&#8221; he asked quickly. &#8220;The paper
prints in both Japanese and English. I have
been so busy writing important letters that
I&#8217;ve not had time to open the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled broadly. It was the first time
that morning that he had felt he could indulge
in such a luxury.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;There would have been one,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;only the man who was taking it to the
&#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217;s&#8217; office lost it and O&#8217;Neil and
Marley found it and gave it to us. I have it
in my valise there in my room. It&#8217;s a tirade
against us, written in English.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers went with the midshipmen
a short distance up the corridor and
waited at the threshold while Phil entered
his room to obtain the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; came in a startled voice from
the midshipman, after he had tumbled out on
the floor the contents of his and Sydney&#8217;s
valises. &#8220;I am sure I put it here,&#8221; he exclaimed
anxiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s not here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s face was pale and worried as he
met his captain&#8217;s gaze at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are under a close espionage,&#8221; Captain
Rodgers said smilingly; &#8220;after all, that can do
us no harm. We can hardly be credited with
an attempt to run ourselves down. While
you are about it, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he added jokingly
as he started away, &#8220;you had better
add this to your confessions to Takishima. I
am afraid no one else would believe you, but
he has known you both so long that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
sure he will not credit you with such barefaced
villainy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything has gone wrong.&#8221; Phil&#8217;s voice
was almost tearful as he sat on the edge of the
bed and contemplated his disordered valise
after Captain Rodgers had gone. &#8220;What
will they believe after finding this and the
secret document both in my possession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll think you are a bungler as a confidence
man,&#8221; Sydney replied, half smiling in
spite of the serious aspect of the situation.
&#8220;But we can explain it all to Taki.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face brightened at this note of optimism
in his friend&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure that Impey is behind all this
trouble,&#8221; he said thoughtfully. &#8220;How on
earth he found the lost document I can&#8217;t
imagine, and I have my doubts whether it
contained the information given by him to
the ambassador. Unfortunately, that we shall
never know. If we could trace this other
letter to his door, I believe the whole insidious
influence that is breeding ill feeling between
the two nations would come to a stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter was picked up by me and
handed to Impey&#8217;s friend. He claimed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and I hurriedly handed it over,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;If I had only refused and held on
to it all this trouble could not have happened.
Maybe to go with Takishima and
talk to Impey we might force him to confess
to his part in the plot and then expose him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid he&#8217;s too clever to be trapped
that way,&#8221; Phil returned smilingly. &#8220;The
ambassador has cautioned secrecy, so we can&#8217;t
divulge what he has told us. If I claimed
before him that I had found the letter in his
room he would either deny it or show great
joy in finding that he had not lost it, professing
that he was on the point of returning it
when the assault occurred. He may even
now have told the Japanese officials that he
had recovered the letter for them only to lose
it. It&#8217;s a mighty embarrassing position to be
in, Syd,&#8221; Phil ended sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will the United States do if Japan
seizes the Chinese ships?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we
should do anything. It would be a question
between Japan and China.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it wouldn&#8217;t mean war?&#8221; Sydney
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;There are some annoying diplomatic questions
yet unsettled between Japan and the
United States, and a thing of that sort might
be used to cause a diplomatic rupture. Let
us hope that it is untrue, and if true, that the
two countries will be able to adjust their
differences amicably.&#8221; But the youngster felt
down in his heart that if what Impey had
said was true there was serious danger of an
open rupture between the two friendly nations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE CONSPIRATORS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Impey</span>, much elated over his success
in throwing the entire blame upon the
shoulders of the American midshipmen, left
the two Japanese naval officers in Captain
Inaba&#8217;s office and sought out his friend and
co-conspirator, Baron Kosuba.</p>

<p>No word was spoken beyond those of welcome
until after the servants had withdrawn,
then when they were alone together Baron
Kosuba said:</p>

<p>&#8220;After our conversation of yesterday I went
at once to see the prime minister and the Minister
of Marine, and they assured me that
Japan would buy the Chinese ships at once.
I have guaranteed the payment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know already,&#8221; Impey returned hurriedly.
&#8220;The letter advising the purchase
was lost. Captain Inaba believes the Americans
have discovered his secret.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Lost!&#8221; the baron exclaimed, a smile almost
of triumph in his eyes. &#8220;How could
the infallible Captain Inaba be guilty of such
carelessness?&#8221; It was plain that Baron
Kosuba and the naval strategist were not the
best of friends. Doubtless the baron resented
the younger man&#8217;s power.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, baron,&#8221; Impey interrupted, &#8220;I have
little time. I have come to you on a most
important matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Japanese nobleman inclined his head
as a sign that he was ready to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, in but a few hours, the Emperor
will receive the American captain,&#8221; Impey hastened
to say. &#8220;This audience must not take
place. It is rumored that he is a special emissary
from the President of the United States.
If this audience cannot be stopped your
dreams of naval supremacy in the Pacific will
be at an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should this audience change the
naval policy of my country?&#8221; Baron Kosuba
exclaimed. &#8220;The entire naval board is
pledged for a strong navy, and only yesterday
agreed to advise buying China&#8217;s ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the United States should agree to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
up her intention of obtaining these ships,&#8221;
Impey said, &#8220;would not Japan hesitate before
expending this large sum of money?
The necessity would seem to be over. The
consequence would be,&#8221; Impey declared, &#8220;that
America would go on building war-ships,
and the time would have passed when your
country can secure the supremacy of the
Pacific.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron&#8217;s face was wrinkled in deep
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I prevent the audience?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must rest with you,&#8221; Impey said
with a shrug. &#8220;If it takes place America
will triumph over you commercially.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baron Kosuba was much affected by Impey&#8217;s
words. He was not entirely patriotic.
His country&#8217;s welfare was second only to the
accumulation of his riches. If the American
navy could be destroyed, her merchant marine
must die and his own steamers increase
and multiply, for there were no other competitors
worthy of notice. And for this he
would gladly force a war.</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States fears now that she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
gone too far,&#8221; Impey added after a short silence.
&#8220;I have told you that the Washington
government has agreed to buy the ships,
and are now worried over Japan&#8217;s attitude.
They fear that Japan will seize the Chinese
ships. Their fleet in Manila is ready to move
at a moment&#8217;s notice, and it is between the
Japanese fleet and the Chinese squadron.
Once the Washington government knows for
certain that Japan has made her decision it
will drop the mask of friendship and order its
fleet to obtain the ships before they reach
Singapore. This mission of the &#8216;Alaska,&#8217; as I
have told you before, is intended only as a
blind to their real intentions, and if Japan is
weak enough to believe in America&#8217;s honesty
then our work will have been for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baron&#8217;s face expressed his anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go at once to the navy department,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;and I trust I can stop
this audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey bade good-bye to the financier, smiling
proudly as they shook hands. He had
won his point. Baron Kosuba would go immediately
to his friend the Minister of Marine.
Impey knew that before now Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Inaba would have laid before that official
proofs of the guilt of the American visitors,
which would bear out the baron&#8217;s arguments.
If the Minister of Marine could be convinced,
then his powerful influence would surely defeat
the audience with the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What should be his next move?&#8221; was the
question uppermost in his mind as he drove
rapidly toward the city from the baron&#8217;s
home. To make the United States see her apparent
danger, and cause her to seize the ships
at once was the result desired.</p>

<p>After Impey had left Captain Inaba&#8217;s office
Lieutenant Takishima had entered. The
former handed him the &#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; letter
to read.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not written by one of my friends,&#8221;
Takishima exclaimed finally, throwing the
letter on the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why should it be found in one of
their valises?&#8221; Captain Inaba asked. &#8220;Why
will you defend them when you know that
they concealed the official letter lost by Oka?
Do you call that a friendly act? If it hadn&#8217;t
been for Impey&#8217;s vigilance and the honesty of
a former countryman of ours, we would never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
have found out that these friends are really
spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be likely that they would call
themselves spies,&#8221; Takishima picked up the
&#8220;Shimbunshi&#8221; letter, and pointed to the
words, &#8220;if they contemplated such work?&#8221;
Takishima&#8217;s voice was triumphant, while Captain
Inaba was silent. &#8220;If they are spies
they did not write this letter. If they wrote
this letter they are not spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your reasoning, my dear Takishima, is
quite illogical. They wrote the letter before
they found the Oka document. Don&#8217;t you
see? With that in their possession they decided
not to send this letter to the &#8216;Shimbunshi.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would the &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; publish such a
letter, not knowing who the author was?&#8221;
Takishima asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; is a syndicate newspaper,
owned mostly by foreigners. It is an
investment, is unpatriotic and appeals to the
worst in men. I believe it will publish anything,
no matter what the source, if a sensation
can be produced,&#8221; Inaba answered
thoughtfully. &#8220;There is but one thing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
fears to do, and that is attack the government
of His Majesty, for then it would be suppressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever doubted the honesty of
Impey?&#8221; Takishima asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My nature is to be suspicious of every
one,&#8221; Inaba replied smilingly. &#8220;Impey,
among the rest, has fallen under my espionage.
Until Impey came to me and explained
everything I believed he had betrayed us.
The letter was in his hands last night. It
passed from him to our men and was at one
time in the hands of the American midshipmen.
It was afterward in the hands of one
of their sailors. Impey located the letter and
brought me the information not an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What great harm would there be if the
letter was read by the Americans?&#8221; Takishima
questioned anxiously. &#8220;It is all true,
in fact a matter of common knowledge, except
the buying of the ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inaba shrugged his square shoulders while
the old sinister smile played about the corners
of his straight lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American fleet is in Manila, holding
its yearly target practice. Is it merely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
coincidence that it should have arrived there
just now? Did it take a fifteen thousand
mile cruise by way of the Cape of Good
Hope merely to hold this target practice?&#8221;
Takishima shook his head impatiently. &#8220;For
some years Japan has lagged behind other
nations in building war-ships because our
country must meet other expenses, and our
countrymen are already taxed to the utmost.
America and the other nations have outstripped
us. The addition of these ships
would give us the additional strength which
we have lost by an unwise naval policy.
Again our growing merchant marine would
have ample protection. Again we would become
a factor to be reckoned with in the Far
East. Baron Kosuba is our strongest friend
in urging the transaction. I believe if America
knew for a certainty that we would acquire
these ships she would buy them herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To fight us with?&#8221; Takishima asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can say?&#8221; Inaba returned. &#8220;Whom
can we trust? Even your old schoolmates
have turned against you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;Then if the information that we had decided
to acquire China&#8217;s ships were known in
America, you believe that she would buy
them ahead of us?&#8221; Takishima asked. &#8220;Is
that your meaning? And afterward you think
she might endeavor to force a war to despoil
us of our Chinese territory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not say so,&#8221; Inaba answered
promptly. &#8220;But we navy men must take
no chances. His Majesty depends upon us.
Let us hope that such a catastrophe will never
occur.&#8221; Captain Inaba picked up several
papers from his desk and handed them to
Takishima. &#8220;In these two telegrams is the
key to the mystery. One is to the State Department
in Washington&mdash;the other to the
governor in Manila, both from the American
ambassador. They are in cipher and quite
beyond our powers to decipher. Their timeliness
alone seems to divulge the possible
context. I believe that they give the intelligence
gained from the lost document.
There is but one thing for us to do.&#8221; Inaba&#8217;s
voice was low and earnest. &#8220;Hold these
cablegrams, send out a sufficient force to
man the Chinese ships, and take possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of them on the high seas before the United
States can do so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s eyes opened wide, while his
heart beat faster. He glanced up and saw
the calm face of the Minister of Marine in the
doorway.</p>

<p>Admiral Kamikura and Captain Inaba
had been in consultation for nearly an hour
while Takishima in his own office awaited
the outcome. The plan advanced by the
bold Inaba seemed dangerous in the extreme.
It might lead to war&mdash;to war with a country
that he looked upon as partly his own. He
had spent four happy years at the Naval
Academy at Annapolis. He knew the American
navy and admired it. The American
people he had studied in all their phases.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their thoughts are not upon war, but
history shows that when war comes they can
fight as hard and as long as any people in
the world,&#8221; he exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>Within the hour Inaba sent for him. The
admiral had gone. The captain&#8217;s face was
grave, but his eyes were bright with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry I cannot be at your lunch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
party to-day,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;I am off to
Sasebo. Give my regards and sayonara to
your sister, O Hama-san. I can tell you
nothing more, Takishima,&#8221; he added, seeing
that a question trembled on the lad&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>Takishima bowed low, murmuring a wish
that good luck attend him upon his mission;
then the door closed behind him.</p>

<small>THE QUARREL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not a happy party that assembled
in the old Count Takishima&#8217;s spacious dining-hall.
Phil and Sydney were anxious and uncomfortable;
Lieutenant Takishima was preoccupied,
while an atmosphere of depression
hung over every one else at the feast. The
meal was served in the Japanese fashion, the
guests seated upon soft cushions on the mat-covered
floor.</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s father, an old Samurai and a
count of the empire, received his guests with
distinguished courtesy, bowing low and welcoming
each arrival with the vaunted gallantry
of Japan&#8217;s ancient chivalry. Takishima&#8217;s
sister was wistfully silent. She had
been told that Captain Inaba had gone away
on duty for the Emperor, and was sad and
disconsolate. O Chio-san and Helen Tillotson
were the only ones who evinced a semblance
of gaiety for the feast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Phil found himself next to Helen, and the
girl did her utmost to draw him out of his
fit of despondency.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned Samurai, whose two children
had been educated in America, made
heroic efforts to induce his son and daughter
to interpret for him his expressions of welcome,
but he soon gave it up as an impossible
task and lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>It was not until Takishima&#8217;s sister Hama-san
had carried off the women guests to show
Helen that part of the house reserved for
women&#8217;s eyes alone, and the old count also
withdrew, that the midshipmen found themselves
alone with their classmate.</p>

<p>In Takishima&#8217;s bosom there rankled the
thought placed there against his will by Captain
Inaba&#8217;s words, that these two friends had
contemptibly betrayed him. While professing
their friendship they had secretly taken
and read an official letter sealed with the
sacred seal of the Emperor. Furthermore,
they had been guilty of writing a sensational
story calculated to stir up the Emperor&#8217;s subjects
against Americans. And yet here they
were his guests, under his father&#8217;s roof. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
situation, to one brought up to cherish high
ideals of honor, was intolerable. The sanctity
of the home was his strongest heritage. An
enemy was ever safe when under the family
roof-tree. He decided that he would take
them elsewhere. He could not be impolite
in his own home. The laws of the host
for centuries forbade an unkind word to be
spoken to a guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Tillotson will be driven home by
O Chio-san,&#8221; Takishima said awkwardly, as
he led the way through the garden toward the
gate. The midshipmen followed in silence,
glad to leave the heavy atmosphere; to be
free of the impressive and studied politeness
of their classmate. Both lads felt keenly the
accusing sting in Takishima&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must explain,&#8221; Sydney whispered as
the three took waiting jinrikishas and were
quickly in motion on the smooth boulevard.</p>

<p>The three had not gone a half mile before a
fourth rikisha came trotting up and the self-satisfied
face of Robert Impey smiled from its
raised hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid I had missed you,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Can I speak to you, lieutenant?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
he asked, motioning his sturdy coolie to steer
up alongside of the rikisha of the Japanese
naval officer.</p>

<p>Takishima bent his head to listen. The
midshipmen kept their eyes and ears to the
front while the low murmur of Impey&#8217;s voice
came to them indistinctly.</p>

<p>Shibu park was soon reached and the coolies
having had their instructions entered the
shady roadway leading to a tea house frequented
by foreigners.</p>

<p>The four men were led into the garden by
daintily gowned Japanese girl attendants and
located under the foliage of a spreading oak
at a table cunningly made from a clinging
grape-vine. The two midshipmen were not,
however, in the mood to notice the natural
beauties of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Phil was inwardly annoyed at Impey&#8217;s
presence. He blamed him for his present
predicament, and before him how was he to
explain the intolerable situation?</p>

<p>&#8220;The audience of the American captain with
His Majesty has been postponed,&#8221; Impey said
carelessly, noting with evident enjoyment the
surprise and alarm in the faces of the Americans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Phil&#8217;s heart almost stopped beating.
What Captain Rodgers had feared had taken
place! Takishima&#8217;s lips trembled. With
that power of restraint cultivated by the people
of his race for centuries he succeeded in
controlling his features. No other outward
expression of the effect of Impey&#8217;s words was
evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217;s&#8217; bulletin-boards is
a cable from America that the Chinese government
has agreed to turn over its new navy to
America.&#8221; Impey strove to show unconcern,
giving the startling news in his every-day
voice. &#8220;The bulletin says that the President
at a cabinet meeting this morning decided to
buy the ships and had sent orders to the United
States fleet in Manila to receive and man
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima trembled inwardly with rage
against his former friends. Then Captain
Inaba had failed to stop their cable to America.
Now he looked upon them as his avowed
enemies. Had they not spied upon his countrymen?
Had they not stolen secret letters
and divulged them? And that while protesting
their love and friendship for him and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
country. Phil sat next to him, his face pale
and his eyes wide with excitement. Impey&#8217;s
part in this international tragedy was clearing
before his eyes. This two-faced scoundrel had
stood in with both parties, warning each that
the other was striving to obtain the ships.
With consummate cunning he had covered up
his tracks. Each side believed in his loyalty.
How he had obtained the secret letter Phil
could not fathom, but that letter contained the
information which, upon its being known in
Washington where the ambassador had cabled
it, had decided the United States government
to take a step which was unparalleled in its
history; a step taken only as a necessary
measure just before the outbreak of a war.
Phil gazed into Takishima&#8217;s face. He was
startled at the sudden gleam of hatred in the
dark eyes of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Japan we cut open the carcasses of
such traitors as you and feed them to the
pigs,&#8221; the Japanese lieutenant cried in a voice
scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p>Both midshipmen jumped to their feet.
Greater consternation could not have been
caused by the explosion of a shell in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
midst. The slowly spoken direct words were
too plain to be misunderstood. Impey sat by
in silence, an outraged expression on his face.
He raised his hand in the r&ocirc;le of peacemaker.
The two men of different races and traditions
stood face to face; one self-controlled, disdainful,
the pride of the old time Samurai, generations
of them, looking out of unbending and
unflinching eyes; the other angry, hurt,
surprised into a stupid, stolid silence, stung to
the quick by the vituperation in his erstwhile
friend&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash; Why, what do you mean?&#8221; Phil
gasped, his face livid. He towered head and
shoulders above his unflinching accuser.</p>

<p>Phil took a step forward, putting out his
right hand impetuously. No idea of menace
entered his mind. His one idea was to stay
the torrent of abuse that he knew was undeserved,
no matter how black the case looked
against him. It cut him to the quick to be
so severely arraigned. Takishima, his mind
embittered by the convincing chain of evidence,
saw only a threat in the attitude of the
young giant. So quickly that the eye could
not follow, the Japanese stooped under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
midshipman&#8217;s outstretched hand, seizing Phil&#8217;s
wrist in an iron grip with his left hand, then
catching the midshipman&#8217;s right leg back of
the knee with his right hand, suddenly
straightened his sapling-like body and threw
the astonished lad with great force over his
head. Phil fell with a crash to the stone
pavement and lay there completely stunned.</p>

<p>Sydney made a step forward, his blood boiling
at this unprovoked jiu-jitsu attack, but
Impey interposed his bulk, and calmer judgment
prevailed as he realized the difference in
size between himself and his one time friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little coward,&#8221; he hissed angrily as
he raised Phil to his feet. There was blood
on the lad&#8217;s face from a cut on his head made
by a sharp edge of a stone in the gravel walk.
&#8220;You deserve a good thrashing for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima stood his ground. &#8220;I am prepared,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;I should think
you&#8217;d both be ashamed to show your faces
after your deceitful conduct.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_242.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;YOU DESERVE A GOOD<br />
THRASHING FOR THIS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Phil steadied himself by the table, gazing
stupidly at the small crowd of excited Japanese
and foreigners that had collected about
them. He had paid no attention to the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
of Takishima&#8217;s defense. The midshipmen
and Takishima were in uniform, and a great
depression overcame Phil as he thought of the
possible publicity of the affair. The attack
had been so sudden and the blow on the head
so stunning that for a second no thought of
revenge came into his mind. Then his dazed
eyes fell upon the unruffled little figure of his
assailant, and a wild fury suddenly welled
into his eyes. With a savage cry he shook
off Sydney&#8217;s retaining hand and in one stride
reached the object of his mad rage. No jiu-jitsu
art was possible. The little naval man
felt himself seized as if by two iron rods and
raised above the ground. For the fraction of
a second he was held poised, then as a great
mastiff might chastise an obstreperous terrier,
Phil shook him until every bone in his body
rattled. The combined efforts of Sydney and
Impey became necessary to save Takishima
from serious injury.</p>

<p>Fortunately the affair was over before a
large crowd could collect, and Impey managed
to hurry them into their jinrikishas and drive
quickly away.</p>

<p>A half hour later Phil and Sydney were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
back in their room at the hotel, while Impey
had gone away with the Japanese naval man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, I wouldn&#8217;t have had that happen for
anything in the world.&#8221; Phil was nearly in
tears as he threw himself on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll undoubtedly challenge you,&#8221; Sydney
replied gravely. &#8220;I saw it in his face;
it was so determined and quiet. If he does,
what will you do? You can&#8217;t fight him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must!&#8221; Phil declared. &#8220;To these people
the code of honor is the same as it was
with us a hundred years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you do, it means disgrace and dismissal
from the navy,&#8221; Sydney protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I laid myself open to it when I put my
hands on him,&#8221; Phil insisted stubbornly.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t fight in the American style, with
fists. I am twice his size. It&#8217;s the only redress
he has. His code of honor demands a duel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s child&#8217;s talk, Phil, and you know
it,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed heatedly. &#8220;I am not
going to stand by and let you ruin your career
on account of a foolish out-of-date code of
honor. Our articles for the government of
the navy forbid a duel, and the penalty is
dismissal. I&#8217;ll go and see Taki.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;You won&#8217;t do any such thing,&#8221; Phil replied
sternly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait to hear from him.
If he wants satisfaction I shall give it to him,
and shall select small swords. I can shoot
all around him with a revolver, but at the
Academy we were equally matched with foils.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall ask Impey to act as my second,
much as I dislike and distrust him,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey for second! What are you talking
about?&#8221; Sydney demanded. &#8220;I am your
second if you are really going to be foolish
enough to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember the articles of war, Syd.&#8221; Phil
smiled a ghastly smile. &#8220;&#8216;Who fights a duel
or acts as a second in a duel.&#8217; You don&#8217;t suppose
I would let you jeopardize your career.
Impey will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think a straight-jacket is what you need
instead of a second,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in
annoyance. &#8220;If I had you tightly strapped
into one, I&#8217;d have you carried off to the ship
and put in a cell until after she sailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he added in answer to a knock.</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers entered the room and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just returned after a fruitless attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to break down the stubborn resistance
of that wall of officialdom around a throne,&#8221;
he said sadly as he unloosed the buttons on
his tightly fitted special dress coat. &#8220;I talked
with both the prime minister and the Minister
of Marine. &#8216;They were very sorry, but His
Majesty was quite too ill to see anybody, but
an audience would be arranged at a very
early date.&#8217; I knew that His Majesty was
probably at that minute riding his favorite
horse within the palace grounds and they saw
that I knew it was only a diplomatic way of
saying: &#8216;We do not desire that you should see
His Majesty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They believe we are here to spy on them,&#8221;
he added, after a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;Did you
make it straight with your Japanese classmate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil swallowed hard and shook his head
sorrowfully while Sydney came to his friend&#8217;s
aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t get a chance, but we shall this
evening. We expect to meet him soon, don&#8217;t
we, Phil?&#8221; he asked grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may clear the atmosphere,&#8221; the captain
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the aspect of it. Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
you heard of the bulletin in front of the
&#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; office? There were thousands
of Japanese standing in front reading it when
we drove past.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty quick work. The ambassador
sent a cable this morning, and here we
get action in the afternoon. If word went to
Manila at the same time we may be getting
our orders to sail at any moment. I&#8217;ve already
cabled my failure to obtain an audience.&#8221;
Captain Rodgers opened the door as
he finished speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, sir. What can we do for you?&#8221;
he exclaimed in surprise as a dapper Japanese
naval lieutenant stood at the threshold.
Phil&#8217;s heart was beating wildly. Here was
Takishima&#8217;s representative. The relations
between the two countries would now be
further strained when this unfortunate duel
was made public.</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to speak with Meester Perry and
Meester Monroe,&#8221; the newcomer replied
politely, bowing profusely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; Captain Rodgers returned,
smiling and motioning him to enter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
&#8220;Good-bye. Keep out of trouble,&#8221; he added
banteringly as he bowed and left them with
the Japanese lieutenant, no thought of the
seriousness of the call entering his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come from Count Lieutenant Takishima
with his card,&#8221; the newcomer said importantly
and in carefully studied English.</p>

<p>Sydney made a move to step forward, but
Phil interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him I am at his service. The
weapons will be small swords, time as soon as
possible. He may name the place,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stood with puzzled face for a
second translating and digesting the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be here again, soon.&#8221; He spoke
hesitatingly, not sure of his meaning. The
lads bowed in response to his ceremonious
farewell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE YACHT &#8220;SYLVIA&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span> and Marley sat dejectedly in the
luxuriously upholstered chairs of the yacht&#8217;s
cabin and gazed upon each other with a
mixture of annoyance and humor. It was
plain to their nautical eyes that the hatch
above them which they had heard closed
tightly and dogged, was the only means of
exit. They were securely imprisoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, it&#8217;s terrible to have such confiding
natures,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed glumly. &#8220;We
walked into this with our eyes wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he added surprisedly, &#8220;they&#8217;ve
stopped heaving in, and there goes the launch
down again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailormen&#8217;s faces were at the nearest air
ports and it was soon plain enough to O&#8217;Neil
what had taken place on deck as he saw the
lowered launch shove off from the yacht&#8217;s
side, and shoot swiftly shoreward.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that villain Impey in her stern
sheets. See him, Bill?&#8221; he cried out angrily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>Marley&#8217;s unsophisticated face betrayed not
a gleam of intelligence as to what this move
might mean, so the boatswain&#8217;s mate turned
from the air port, threw himself back in his
chair and began to elucidate.</p>

<p>&#8220;They thought the Japs had pinched this
letter from Mr. Impey last night, so they were
leaving the country before they&#8217;d get jailed.
This letter here was sealed, and Impey and
Randall have opened it and read it. So they
were proper scared. But now their minds are
easy again. Do you see?&#8221; he ended, his voice
becoming serious in tone. &#8220;We are the goats,
and they&#8217;ll keep us here until we can&#8217;t do
them any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he mean about Japan seizing
the Chinese ships?&#8221; Marley asked. That was
the important thing in his mind. Everything
else he classed as diplomatic Greek and
he was determined not to understand it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that China has a new navy
coming out,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered patiently; &#8220;the
ships were built in Europe, and it looks
to me that if Japan took these ships she
would do it so as to lick us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ain&#8217;t we got nothing to say?&#8221; Marley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
questioned perplexedly. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t looking
for a fight with Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but some of our wise guys think that
we&#8217;ve got something that she wants; the
Philippines, you see. And then there&#8217;s this
open door flimflam in China. It&#8217;s a big question,
Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil, while he was educating his friend
upon the intricate and unexplained steps that
frequently in the past had led into war
nations apparently friendly, allowed his gaze
to roam searchingly over the contents of the
cabin. He noticed a door leading into what
he supposed was a stateroom, and as he
finished speaking he arose and tried the door-knob.
It was unlocked, and the sailor pushed
it open and cast a glance within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wireless!&#8221; he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a chance,&#8221; he muttered jubilantly.
&#8220;Somebody may be listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil surveyed the room minutely. He
saw that the yacht&#8217;s wireless set was of the
same manufacture as the one installed on
board the &#8220;Alaska.&#8221; He thanked his luck
for the practice he had taken in his leisure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
moments under the guidance of the midshipmen
in learning the operation of the outfit.
He saw that everything was connected, and
that the power of the yacht&#8217;s dynamos was
there at his service upon the closing of the
switch on the table before him. He glanced
closely at the tuning device, and although he
did not understand the theory of wave lengths,
he remembered that the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; pointer
was usually set at or near the figure four
hundred. Quickly making this adjustment,
he closed the switch and heard the hum of
the alternating current motor generator transferring
the direct current of the yacht to an
alternating one of high frequency and tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;this little machine
here may get us out of the brig before our
term of confinement expires! They&#8217;ll cut the
aerial as soon as they can after they hear the
noise from the spark-gap. What&#8217;ll I say?&#8221;
he asked thoughtfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s got to be short
and yet tell &#8217;em enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly his hand moved quickly, rhythmically,
and the white arc across the air-gap
sizzled and rasped. Then the boatswain&#8217;s
mate suddenly threw out the sending circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
and listened eagerly through the telephone
head-piece for an answer. Marley observed a
satisfied smile on his face as he again threw
in the sending circuit, and for several minutes
the spark leaped and played under its
glass case like a thing alive. The noise of
the arc drowned out completely the click of
the key. Then the metallic sound of the key
suddenly was heard, showing that the aerial
wire had been severed on deck, and O&#8217;Neil
threw off his head-gear and slapped Marley a
resounding blow across the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, every ship in the harbor knows that
there&#8217;s a mutiny on the &#8216;Sylvia,&#8217;&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;I was afraid the &#8216;Alaska&#8217; wasn&#8217;t listening,
so I made the &#8216;general call.&#8217; Now when the
first boat comes alongside, you and I have got
to make as much noise as Buffalo Bill&#8217;s Wild
West and Pawnee Bill&#8217;s Far East, in one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sailors were not kept long in suspense.
O&#8217;Neil from his point of vantage soon
espied one of the &#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; steam cutters,
full of armed men, standing down toward the
yacht&#8217;s gangway, while he heard the excited
and joyful voice of Marley from his station
on the other side of the cabin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;Here comes a Jap steam launch full of
our little friends. I never was so glad to see
any one not of my own race before.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Marley, like two men at a race-meet
encouraging their favorite horses, called
out loudly, cheering the two boats on. The
steam launch from the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; passed close
to his air port.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the mutineers, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried
out loudly across the ten feet of intervening
water. &#8220;They&#8217;re holding Marley and me
prisoners here in the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the hatchway was
undogged and lifted and the two sailors came
up blinking into the sunlight. They saw
Randall and his friend closely guarded by
both the Japanese and American rescue party,
and O&#8217;Neil could not suppress an amused
smile as he read real terror on their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll feel worse than that in a few minutes!&#8221;
the boatswain&#8217;s mate exclaimed hotly
to the discomfited Randall. Then he put his
hand into his shirt and pulled out the letter
which had been the cause of all the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winston,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, &#8220;here&#8217;s
a letter I found in the yacht&#8217;s cabin. Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Marley and I have been chasing these fellows
to get it since last night. When they found
we had it, they locked us in the cabin.&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s face was serious as he told the story,
which was quite near the real facts. Randall&#8217;s
jaw dropped, and he would have denied
the sailor&#8217;s words, but that he saw by the intimidating
faces of the Japanese sailors that
his denial would fall upon deaf ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Japanese officer will know what it is;
I can&#8217;t read the language,&#8221; the sailor added.
&#8220;It was opened just as you see it when we
found it. Wasn&#8217;t it, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley&#8217;s face broke into a happy smile as
he assured the assembled officers and men,
who had been progressively arriving as
quickly as the numerous boats could land at
the two gangways, that every word spoken by
O&#8217;Neil was the gospel truth.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Winston took the letter and
handed it over to the Japanese lieutenant
who had been the first to arrive. Winston&#8217;s
face wore a solemn air of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does all this mean, O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; he
asked sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;These varmints,&#8221; pointing to the now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
trembling prisoners, &#8220;have been writing up
all kinds of lies for a Japanese paper, and
they were trying to make off with this
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Japanese lieutenant&#8217;s face wore a
puzzled look; he tried in vain to follow the
English of the sailor. Winston turned to
him and in simpler language explained the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my men back to the ship,&#8221; he
ended, bowing, hand to his cap, while the
Japanese officer insisted upon shaking both
O&#8217;Neil and Marley by the hand and thanking
them solemnly for their great service to his
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied.
&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll give those white-livered guys
there a hot line of Japanese argument.
Where I come from there&#8217;d be a tar and
feather party.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Japanese lieutenant smiled again, much
puzzled, apologizing that he could speak and
understand so little English.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said as he
obeyed the signal to embark. &#8220;Just don&#8217;t
understand a word they say, for it won&#8217;t be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
true, anyway. What I&#8217;ve told you is the
correct dope.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the American launch had shoved off
from the yacht and was standing back to
the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; some hundreds or more yards
away, Lieutenant Winston turned an inquiring
glance on the boatswain&#8217;s mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must have been an important
letter,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;by the way the
officer pounced on it and stowed it away
in his tunic pocket. Do you know what was
in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not first hand. No, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied
soberly. &#8220;But that fellow Randall knows all
about it, or I miss my guess.&#8221;</p>

<small>INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Japanese officer had taken his
abrupt departure Phil looked despondent.</p>

<p>&#8220;This thing must not occur, Phil,&#8221; Sydney
cried out earnestly, laying his hand affectionately
upon the shoulder of his classmate.
&#8220;The whole miserable affair can and must be
explained. To fight this duel would only
heap fuel on the already smouldering fire of
misunderstanding between the two countries.
It is our duty,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;to go to Taki and
unmask this man Impey; don&#8217;t you see by
remaining passive we are aiding him in his
designs, whatever they may be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil sat unmoved, apparently unheeding
his friend&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t considered, Syd,&#8221; he replied
sadly. &#8220;These Japanese are not like our own
people. I have done bodily injury to an
officer of the Emperor of Japan in his sacred
uniform. Until he kills me the shame cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
be wiped out. So you see,&#8221; he ended hopelessly,
&#8220;I must fight; there is no other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Sydney persisted unconvinced,
&#8220;suppose we told him where you found the
document and that you had the best of intentions
and were going to give it to him,
when you found it had been taken away
from you. Couldn&#8217;t you then apologize for
your act, explaining that he misunderstood
you entirely? Surely Taki will be influenced
by his academy training to believe you are
not afraid, but that your only wish is to aid
the two governments to remain on peaceful
terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s answer was prevented by a knock
on the door, and the man who they believed
was at the bottom of their trouble came in.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen did not attempt to
conceal that his presence was unwelcome;
but unheeding the evident coldness of his
reception, he sat down calmly in a vacant
chair, regarding the Americans with a complacent
smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done all I could to dissuade Lieutenant
Takishima,&#8221; Impey began. The midshipmen
winced, for they fully believed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
his protestations of friendship for them were
only feigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he insists upon the challenge. These
Japanese are medi&aelig;val in their methods of
thought. He even talked of hara-kiri. He
said he would be forever disgraced. His soul
revolted at the thought that violent hands
had been laid upon him. You know how
these fellows feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask for your good offices, Mr. Impey,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed in sudden anger. &#8220;I
am fully able to look out for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; Impey returned in a hurt
voice, giving an expressive shrug to his
massive shoulders. &#8220;Of course you have
thought how the duel is going to influence
affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your interest in our doings, Mr. Impey,
for an outsider, seems to me quite extraordinary.&#8221;
Phil spoke in a quieter voice. &#8220;Perhaps
if you would be good enough to explain
a few points to us this duel which you profess
to wish to avoid might be averted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s face flushed, while an uneasiness
crept into his crafty eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the interest of friendship,&#8221; he declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
quickly. &#8220;I have always had the confidence
of your ambassador.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you wouldn&#8217;t mind telling us,&#8221;
Phil asked, &#8220;how you came by the lost naval
document I found in the hand of one of the
secret service men who assaulted you in your
rooms last night.&#8221; Impey regarded Phil in
much surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can easily,&#8221; he declared. His face had
suddenly cleared. &#8220;Was it you then who answered
my call for help? I heard your answer
just as I was losing consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil waved the question aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was found by a friend and given to
me,&#8221; Impey continued after a pause. &#8220;I recognized
it as an important paper, but at that
time I knew nothing of its character. I can
translate Japanese, and instead of going to the
prime minister&#8217;s ball, I made a translation of
that letter. One of my friends, Randall, was
with me and had just gone out when I was
attacked. He discovered me afterward unconscious
on the floor of my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to interrupt with another
question, but Impey hastened on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took it then from my assailants, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
how did it go to the sailors?&#8221; Impey asked.
&#8220;They claim to have found it at the theatre,
and they brought it on board my yacht at
Yokohama, and they are there at this moment&mdash;my
prisoners. In the interest of peace
and for your good I have held them until I
could come to you and privately explain the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second there was silence.
To Phil, Impey&#8217;s voice sounded insincere,
yet everything pointed to its being the
truth. Suddenly Sydney jumped to his feet,
his eyes bright with amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did Taki take the stand he
did? He did not know our connection with
this document?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite simple to explain. Captain
Inaba believes that you, Mr. Perry, had the
letter, for the sailors said they showed it to
your Japanese steward and he was in Captain
Inaba&#8217;s office this morning. I saw him come
away from there myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen exchanged rapid
glances. Had they been mistaken in their
estimate of Impey? Was he after all playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
square? Yet the conversation on the train
was still unexplained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you on the special train that brought
us to Tokyo yesterday?&#8221; Phil suddenly asked,
while Impey, apparently unconscious of the
intended trap being laid for him by the midshipman,
nodded, his face still smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how can you explain as a friend of
the Americans, and holding the confidence of
the American ambassador, your action in assuring
a Japanese companion that America
was negotiating for the Chinese squadron
when you know that it is untrue?&#8221; Phil&#8217;s
voice held a ring of triumph. He watched
Impey&#8217;s face intently, certain of surprising a
guilty start, but he was doomed to disappointment.
Instead the foreigner continued to
placidly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid as detectives you are but a
qualified success,&#8221; Impey said in a patronizing
voice. &#8220;You have unfortunately followed a
blind trail. Everything I have done has
been with Mr. Tillotson&#8217;s fullest approval. In
order to surprise their secret from them I intentionally
made the Japanese officials believe
that the United States was negotiating for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
ships of the new Chinese navy. That I was
successful was shown by the contents of the
lost letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads stood nonplussed before the
wily foreigner. Phil doubted that the ambassador
would give his sanction to such a
method. Impey&#8217;s conduct was inexplicable
to the midshipman. Instead of an enemy, as
they had come to believe him, was he in
reality a friend who had warned their government,
through Mr. Tillotson, of an act
which would harm the &#8220;balance of power&#8221; in
the Far East?</p>

<p>Try as he would Phil felt it was difficult to
regard Impey in this new r&ocirc;le of friend.
Down in the bottom of his heart, he yet mistrusted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, as matters stand,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
perplexedly, &#8220;Perry and I are believed to
be responsible for the lost document, and we
are supposed to have sent it to our ship by
the two sailors. Your part in translating it
and giving the contents to the ambassador is
not known by the Japanese at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey nodded, as he answered quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba knows that I held the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
letter last night, but he still thinks I am
working for him. My men from the yacht
were returning on board, for I was on the
point of taking a trip on her. They met
your two sailors and the Japanese steward on
the train. As easily happens in a foreign
country, they became acquainted, and your
sailors went by invitation on board the yacht.
There they displayed this lost document,
which my men knew at once was important.
When I went on board, ready to sail, they
told me of it, and I found they had imprisoned
your sailors, fearing they might get
in trouble ashore if they were arrested with
this paper on their persons. I at once hastened
back to Tokyo to tell you of it and that
was the reason I followed you and Lieutenant
Takishima. I pretended to have business
with him to allay suspicion and I was endeavoring
to find an opportunity to confide
in one of you when the unfortunate trouble
with the Japanese lieutenant occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say that Sago, our Japanese
steward, has betrayed us by going to Captain
Inaba with his information?&#8221; Phil exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the slightest doubt of it.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Impey&#8217;s voice was quite positive. &#8220;Captain
Inaba is not now in Tokyo; he has gone on
a secret and sudden mission. Lieutenant
Takishima, your friend and classmate, deliberately
and openly insulted you. Would
you want more proof than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this secret mission?&#8221; both lads
asked, their voices rising in excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be over this same troublesome
question&mdash;the Chinese ships,&#8221; Impey replied
readily. &#8220;In my opinion he has gone to
intercept them and thus prevent the United
States from seizing them first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can do nothing,&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can prevent it,&#8221;
Impey answered seriously, inwardly smiling
at the changed attitude of the two midshipmen.
&#8220;Japan is under a military government
and controls the actions of every person
within the empire. It is safe to believe that
the United States government will have no
news of this move until all danger of interruption
from the war-ships in Manila Bay is
passed. Therefore there will be no instructions
to your captain, and without them he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
would hardly dare attempt an act which
might lead to war. He must stay in Yokohama
harbor while Captain Inaba is hastening
with a fast and doubtless powerful force
to seize the Chinese ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose Japan does seize these ships,&#8221;
Sydney said quietly. &#8220;Where is the harm
to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you have not been in the ambassador&#8217;s
confidence,&#8221; Impey replied quickly.
&#8220;China has given to the United States government
a sphere of influence to balance those
of Japan, Russia, Germany and the other
countries of Europe. This sphere is immensely
valuable and coveted by Japan,
which has without China&#8217;s permission begun
a railroad connecting the coal and iron fields
with the railroad won from Russia. Japan is
now wealthy and lacks nothing but war-ships.
With the addition of the new Chinese navy
she will be in a position to push her railroad
clear through into the American sphere, in
fact, force America into the embarrassing
position of refusing this valuable concession
from China.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Impey talked, the lads&#8217; eyes opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
wide in astonishment. They could not believe
that such international dishonesty was
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know all this?&#8221; Sydney asked
in bewilderment.</p>

<p>Impey shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been born and brought up in the
Far East. To me the undercurrent of Oriental
diplomacy is an open book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the ambassador know this?&#8221; Phil inquired
seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all,&#8221; Impey confided mysteriously.
&#8220;I have told him a great deal, but not being
a military man it would do no good to try to
convince him of the danger in the naval
supremacy of Japan after acquiring the
Chinese ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Rodgers should be told this at
once,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, rising and taking
Impey&#8217;s arm. The lad&#8217;s manner had now
entirely changed. The startling news made
him now regard Impey as a friend and ally,
trusting him as completely as he would have
mistrusted him an hour ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry that I have misjudged
you.&#8221; The lad&#8217;s voice was apologetic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;I am only glad that I have been able to
convince you of the danger to your country,&#8221;
Impey answered quickly, &#8220;but wait; no good
can be gained by going to Captain Rodgers.
As I said before, he cannot act without orders,
and orders cannot come, as all cablegrams
will be stopped by the imperial government
until Captain Inaba has secured the Chinese
ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen stared helplessly at Impey,
an anxious question in their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The yacht &#8216;Sylvia&#8217; is our only hope,&#8221;
Impey whispered in an impressive voice.
&#8220;She is faster than a scout cruiser, and is
coaled and ready to sail. With her we can
steam south until we get the fleet at Manila
by wireless, and then send them the news.
That would allow the American admiral to
sail, intercept the Chinese squadron before
Captain Inaba could reach them, and take the
Chinese ships under the American flag into
Manila Bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen paled at the daring of the
plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;The admiral in Manila would not dare act
without direct orders from Washington,&#8221; Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
cried earnestly, &#8220;and would Washington give
such orders without knowing all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There would not be time to wait for
Washington to confirm the admiral&#8217;s decision.
He would have to act promptly, using his own
discretion and take the consequences. I think
you will find the admiral will act without a
second&#8217;s hesitation when he gets the wireless
that we shall send him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed, &#8220;what right
would our admiral have to seize the ships of a
friendly country? If Japan chooses to set
aside international etiquette and commit this
act of piracy on the high seas, that is not
sufficient warrant for us to do the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose the admiral held a written
agreement signed by the Chinese highest
authority, the Wai-Wu-Pu, turning over the
ships to the protection of the United States?&#8221;
Impey asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is this agreement?&#8221; Phil exclaimed
incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my pocket,&#8221; Impey returned, smiling
at the surprise on the lads&#8217; faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would clear the admiral in so far as
China was concerned,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, &#8220;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
he would want direct authority, signed by the
Secretary of the Navy, for such an important
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey shrugged his shoulders and gazed
upon the midshipman pityingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your admiral of course must make his own
choice of action, but I believe he would consider
our news sufficient warrant to act,&#8221; he
replied, rising to his feet and holding out his
hand in farewell.</p>

<p>The lads a half hour before would have
purposely failed to see the friendly advance
of one they had decided was their enemy, but
now they grasped him by the arms and
insisted upon a further explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not likely the Japanese authorities
would allow the &#8216;Sylvia&#8217; to sail?&#8221; Phil
questioned eagerly. &#8220;They are probably now
watching all who go on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your opportunity,&#8221; Impey replied
forcefully. &#8220;You are naval men, and have
been educated to run risks. I offer you the
yacht, and point out the only way to checkmate
Captain Inaba&#8217;s move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221; Phil asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot appear at all,&#8221; Impey explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
quickly and impressively. &#8220;There&#8217;s an English
steamer sailing at midnight for Manila
direct, or I shall go aboard the &#8216;Alaska&#8217; for
safety, leaving the yacht in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot leave our ship in that way!&#8221;
Phil exclaimed. &#8220;Captain Rodgers must be
told our plans, and I am sure he would refuse
to let us go. If he thought the cause
was urgent he would sail with the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;
and wireless the situation to Manila on the
way south.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s face became suddenly grave, and
he drew closer to the midshipman, casting his
eyes apprehensively toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the gravest danger. The ambassador
is the only other person who knows,&#8221;
he said in a low, impressive whisper. &#8220;The
Japanese battle-ships have orders to prevent
by force the sailing of the &#8216;Alaska.&#8217; We do
not dare give this alarming information to
your captain. If he knew he would gladly
fight his way out of Yokohama Bay. We bow
to him as a naval man, but we are not willing
to use his ready diplomacy. The yacht would
cause no comment. The secret document will
be delivered to the Japanese officials, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the night the &#8216;Sylvia&#8217; can easily steal away.
Your ambassador can without arousing suspicion
requisition your services from your captain,
telling him that he needs you for secret
duty, and nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could avoid this meeting with
Takishima,&#8221; Impey added nervously. &#8220;If anything
should happen the opportunity would
be lost.&#8221; He rose again from his chair and
moved toward the door. &#8220;I shall see the
ambassador at once, and endeavor to hurry
the plans along. He will send for you. Meanwhile,&#8221;
he urged, &#8220;do your best to propitiate
that fire-eating little Oriental.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three shook hands, and the door closed
behind the conspirator.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney gazed at each other in
blank amazement. Where was the key to
the problem? Who could be trusted?</p>

<small>THE DUEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span> and his chum Marley had no more
than gotten safely on board the &#8220;Alaska&#8221;
than they were again obtaining permission to
return to Tokyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have some dope on the situation, sir,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil explained to the executive officer,
&#8220;which Captain Rodgers should know at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Permission was readily obtained, and inside
of an hour after their release from their enforced
captivity, they were on the train for
Tokyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew we&#8217;d get the correct dope on that
guy, Impey, before we got through, Bill,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil exclaimed happily. &#8220;He and those
quill-pushers of his have been manufacturing
a war out of nothing. They&#8217;ve had us all
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marley smiled sympathetically, but hardly
intelligently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;You see, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil added confidingly,
&#8220;this gentleman confidence man has been
selling green goods to both sides, and making
each believe that the other fellow is putting
up a game on him. Nations ain&#8217;t like people,&#8221;
he explained; &#8220;people can go to each other
and find out just where they stand with one
another, face to face. The spies of two nations
sometimes get together and sell each
other out and send home false dope. When
two nations are so different, like us and the
Japanese, we have to hire foreign spies because
each would soon get on to the other nation&#8217;s
spies, and then they wouldn&#8217;t be any use.
This man Impey is an international spy; he
belongs to any one who&#8217;ll pay him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sailors took rikishas from the station
in Tokyo, and drove hurriedly to the
hotel. They hoped to find the midshipmen
there, for O&#8217;Neil, true to his allegiance, was
intent upon giving them his important news
first. Then there was time, if the lads saw
fit, to tell Captain Rodgers. In another fifteen
minutes they were knocking at the door
of the American Embassy, where they had
found the lads had gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>The man-of-war&#8217;s men encountered two very
white and frightened women after they had
been led into the hallway by the Japanese
man servant.</p>

<p>The sailors, hat in hand, stood much embarrassed
before Helen Tillotson and her
Japanese girl friend. It was quite evident
to O&#8217;Neil that both had been crying, and
even in his embarrassment the boatswain&#8217;s
mate realized that something near a tragedy
had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. O&#8217;Neil, from the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;?&#8221;
Helen cried eagerly, grasping the startled
man&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;Oh, I am so glad you&#8217;ve
come; something terrible will happen if we
don&#8217;t prevent it at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Mister O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate
corrected, while Marley suppressed a grin at
the title, despite the apparent tragedy believed
to be imminent, &#8220;just plain Jack
O&#8217;Neil, at your service, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will help us,&#8221; Helen begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill and I&#8217;ll follow you into the forbidden
palace of the Mikado, miss, if you say
the word.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil drew himself up proudly,
while a broad Irish smile illumined his honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
face. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, may I ask,
miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; the young girl replied
tearfully. &#8220;Mr. Perry and Lieutenant Takishima
were such good friends, and now his
sister O Hama-san has come to tell me they
are to fight a duel this evening. Don&#8217;t you
see,&#8221; she exclaimed, in an agony of fear,
&#8220;that we must not let this terrible thing
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight a duel!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil gasped, while
Marley twirled his hat in silent excitement.
&#8220;When I seen them last they were as good
friends as two fleas on a dog&#8217;s tail; excuse
the expression, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but since then something came between
them,&#8221; Helen explained breathlessly.
&#8220;It was over some secret letter. It wasn&#8217;t
Mr. Perry&#8217;s fault. He told me about it this
morning. He found this letter and would
have given it to the right owners, but it was
taken from him, and now Lieutenant Takishima
believes that his former friend has
acted dishonestly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, miss,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed,
eagerly, &#8220;Bill and I can explain that. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
found the paper. Mr. Perry lost it before he
could give it to the lieutenant. We&#8217;ve turned
it over to the Japanese naval officers in Yokohama.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a glad cry, Helen Tillotson embraced
her Japanese friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Hama,&#8221; she said tearfully, &#8220;I
knew that we should find a way. Now your
brother will listen to reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s this duel coming off?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked, becoming restive during what he considered
was useless sentimentality.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Shibu Park,&#8221; the Japanese girl replied
quietly. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare interfere without
a strong reason. My brother is bound to
vindicate his honor. If he has misjudged
Mr. Perry&#8217;s acts then the situation is changed.
Come!&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>Helen Tillotson was too greatly relieved
in her distressed mind to think on the words
of her girl friend, and it was only a few
minutes before sunset when the party arrived
at the meeting place in Shibu Park. Leaving
the carriage they followed Hama along the
winding path, past many shaded temples to
a low level stretch of grassy soil before a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
large Buddhist shrine. Before they had
emerged from the wooded path the sound of
strife came faintly to their ears, and Helen&#8217;s
pale face blanched still whiter at the terrifying
clash of steel upon steel.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had pressed ahead, and as he
reached the clearing the sight that met his
gaze made his martial spirit rise within him,
and he could barely refrain from giving a
yell of delight as he watched the evenly
matched contestants.</p>

<p>Phil towered above his small antagonist,
while the two blades hissed and rasped one
upon the other like things alive. Both faces
were pale and set, and over Phil&#8217;s cheek a
trickle of blood showed where his opponent&#8217;s
steel had lightly touched. Sydney, for in
spite of Phil&#8217;s wish he had insisted upon
acting as second, and a Japanese lieutenant
stood, swords in hand, their eyes following
every movement of their principals, to see that
no unfair advantage was gained by either.</p>

<p>The young ladies stopped on the edge of
the woods, enthralled by the sight. Deep
down in the human heart, even in women, is
an instinctive admiration for the fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
man; for one brief second each gazed at her
champion, an almost savage lust for victory,
even through bloodshed, in her eyes. Then
the primitive instinct faded and the American
girl saw the Japanese officer&#8217;s blade prick the
breast of his opponent; she saw her boy
friend give back a step, and with his sword
strike up the other&#8217;s blade, while a deep red
flow of blood gushed from the wound so
deftly made. She gave a distressed cry and
fell into the arms of the calm little Japanese
girl behind her; while unheeding the interruption
at hand the two modern gladiators
fought on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to stop it, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
excitedly as Phil&#8217;s serpent-like point pierced
the sword arm of his skilful antagonist, &#8220;but
they&#8217;ll be hurting each other soon if we
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before O&#8217;Neil could reach the side of the
duelists, Phil&#8217;s powerful blade had wrapped
itself about the singing steel of his antagonist,
and with a powerful stroke down and out,
aided by Takishima&#8217;s loss of power in his
sword arm, sent his opponent&#8217;s blade far across
the grass. It struck the temple wall with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
metallic thud, and lay shivering as if alive
on the wide flag-stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neatly done, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried out in
hearty admiration, as he ran to Phil&#8217;s side
and quietly but masterfully disarmed him.</p>

<p>Takishima stood his ground, unflinchingly,
his arms folded on his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;The game little bantam!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
in a loud aside. &#8220;&#8216;Come and finish
me&#8217; is what he means by that.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re excused,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried in nervous
hilarity; &#8220;nothing doing. Go put on your
coat. Don&#8217;t you see the ladies waiting to
speak to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors and Sydney insisted upon leading
their much bedraggled champion off to
the friendly shelter of a near-by shrine,
where O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s ready resourcefulness quickly
staunched the flow of blood in an ugly wound
on Phil&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a flesh cut,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in
relief after he had examined the wound
and assisted O&#8217;Neil in applying a first-aid
dressing.</p>

<p>Takishima and Lieutenant Tanu, his second,
stood nonplussed at the sudden appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
what they looked upon as an unwarranted interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a nice hospitable way of entertaining
your guests,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed almost
angrily, as he glanced at the haughty faces of
the Japanese officers. &#8220;Civilized people don&#8217;t
fight duels any more. I thought you prided
yourself on being highly enlightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make it any worse than it is,
O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Sydney commanded irritably. &#8220;Mr.
Perry has given him satisfaction, and his life
too, for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it&#8217;s all my fault, Mr. Perry,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said soberly dropping his bantering
manner. &#8220;Bill and I found a letter at the
theatre. It was the one lost by the injured
messenger. If we&#8217;d caught you at the hotel
this morning we&#8217;d have given it to you and
saved all this trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the letter now?&#8221; Phil questioned
anxiously, holding out his hand to O&#8217;Neil,
half expecting to see the sailor produce it
from his blouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in the hands of the Japanese naval
officers at Yokohama.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil imparted the
information, a spark of triumph in his eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
&#8220;Our friend Mr. Impey and his cutthroats
attempted to jail me and Bill here, and lay
hands on the letter, but we fooled &#8217;em, and
when we were let loose, I gave the letter to
the Japanese naval officer that came over in
response to our call for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads looked surprised and puzzled, but
Takishima&#8217;s face as he listened wore an expression
which was hard to interpret.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil quietly and in a few words outlined
the yacht incident, not sparing the two men
who had been aiding Impey to discredit
America in the eyes of the Japanese.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man that brought our flag on the stage
at the theatre last night was with them. I believe
he&#8217;s a Filipino insurgent,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was this letter open,&#8221; Phil asked eagerly,
&#8220;and did you show it to Sago?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;The seal was broken when I got it, sir,&#8221;
the sailor replied. &#8220;I asked Sago to translate
it for us, and he didn&#8217;t tell the correct dope
what was in it, but one of Mr. Impey&#8217;s men
did.&#8221; The sailor looked up questioningly,
jerking his head over toward the listening
Japanese.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;I want them to hear,&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;I want you to tell everything that has happened.
We must clear up this terrible misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They said it was an imperial order to take
the Chinese ships, which would mean war between
the United States and Japan,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
explained. &#8220;When I realized that our having
the letter might bring about ill feeling for the
&#8216;Alaska,&#8217; I put all the blame where it belonged,
for they told me that Mr. Impey had translated
the letter. I told the Japanese naval officer
that we had taken the letter from the two
men on the yacht. Probably those men are
now prisoners on the Jap ships at Yokohama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stepped forward to where Takishima
was standing, a much puzzled expression on
the lieutenant&#8217;s usually calm face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Takishima,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;I
meant to be honest with you, and if I hadn&#8217;t
lost the letter, would have restored it last
night. It seems Mr. Impey has fooled us both.
He is no more my friend than he is yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you did not order your sailors to
secure the letter?&#8221; Takishima asked slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard what O&#8217;Neil has said,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
Phil replied quietly, &#8220;and the &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217;
letter found in my room was written by Impey&#8217;s
men also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima was on the point of inquiring
further; the details of the perplexing tangle
were as yet not clear in his mind, but Phil
had turned away. He had caught a glimpse
of a woman&#8217;s gown, and in confusion gazed at
Helen Tillotson standing near, supported by
her Japanese friend. He was at her side in
an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you come?&#8221; he exclaimed
sternly. &#8220;You must go at once. Sydney,&#8221; he
called, &#8220;please see that Miss Tillotson and
Miss Hama get home safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Helen was not to be treated so lightly.
Her big blue eyes showed a hidden fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you much hurt?&#8221; she asked solicitously,
disregarding the stern command in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all a mistake,&#8221; she added suddenly,
appealing to Takishima. &#8220;Mr. Perry told me
this morning how he lost the letter. He
would have given it to you, and was much
mortified at the thought of being considered
dishonest. Make him acknowledge that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
was wrong in forcing this deplorable duel,&#8221;
she ended pleadingly to Hama at her side.</p>

<p>Very solemnly Takishima put out his hands
to Phil, taking both of the midshipman&#8217;s in
his and wrung them impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, if I were a true Samurai, I would
take my life by hara-kiri, for I have cruelly
misjudged and injured a good friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to both get down on your
knees and thank these two young ladies,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, interrupting the sentimental
scene. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for them
you&#8217;d probably be cutting pieces out of each
other yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil laughed uneasily, and took Helen&#8217;s
trembling hand impetuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; he asked her, as
the party moved away toward the entrance to
the park where their rikishas were waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hama-san came and told me, but she said
she feared her brother too much to interfere,&#8221;
the young girl confided as the pair walked
down the gravel path. &#8220;She believed that
you had betrayed and insulted him, and according
to their code he was bound to kill
you or be killed himself; but when your sailors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
came and explained your innocence, which
bore out what I had told her, she gladly led
us to the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have killed me if he could,&#8221;
Phil said in a low voice, pressing Helen&#8217;s
hand thankfully. &#8220;I saw that in his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the park entrance the party gathered in
the growing darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki,&#8221; Phil said, stepping up to his
friend&#8217;s side, and taking his outstretched
hand, &#8220;now that you know that Impey has
misled your government in supposing that
the United States will seize the Chinese ships,
cannot Captain Inaba be recalled by wireless,
if he has indeed sailed? The situation would
be much clearer if he were back in Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s face showed marked surprise
as he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that Captain Inaba has
sailed, and what his mission is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Phil replied quietly, smiling inwardly
at Taki&#8217;s betrayal, &#8220;but Impey told me
he was sure he had gone to seize the ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever has been ordered by our Emperor
cannot be altered,&#8221; Takishima hastened
to say, &#8220;but I hope that better understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
between our countries will soon come after
the part Impey has played becomes known to
both governments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your Emperor could be convinced that
the United States had no intention of obtaining
the Chinese ships,&#8221; Phil asked eagerly,
&#8220;would he have wanted to obtain them for
Japan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure he would not,&#8221; Takishima replied
readily. &#8220;The price asked is enormous,
much more than it would cost to build them
in my own country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party was breaking up; most of them
had climbed into their jinrikishas, and were
waiting upon the two in absorbed conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must talk over this again to-night,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed as he saw they were keeping
the rest waiting. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you at our ambassador&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima nodded, and the next moment
the entire party was in motion.</p>

<p>Phil was deep in silent meditation. He
was thinking over a plan; one similar to that
proposed by Impey, but with a vastly different
purpose.</p>

<small>INDECISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> seeing Helen Tillotson to the embassy,
Phil and Sydney went direct to the
hotel, for there was but scant time to dress
and accompany Captain Rodgers to the state
dinner, given that evening by the American
ambassador to the visiting officers and their
Japanese naval hosts.</p>

<p>Bursting with the important and exciting
news, the two lads, heedless of Phil&#8217;s appearance
in his blood-stained uniform, went
straightway to Captain Rodgers&#8217; room.
There they found their commanding officer in
the midst of his toilet, and they gave a gasp
of surprise to see Sago, the steward, quietly
aiding his master in his dressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; was Captain Rodgers&#8217; cheery
answer to their inquiry through the half open
door. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he cried
out in alarm after one glance at Phil&#8217;s blood-stained
face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Phil stood nonplussed before his captain.
Sago turned pale under his parchment-like
skin. Before the midshipman could speak,
the steward attempted to excuse himself and
withdraw, but Sydney barred his way and the
two lads entered the room, closing the door
behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth has happened?&#8221; Captain
Rodgers exclaimed sternly.</p>

<p>Phil saw his reflection in the glass, and the
sight caused him to start in alarm. One side
of his face was smeared with blood; his coat
was open, and inside his white shirt there
showed a red blot from the wound on his
chest. He knew the hurts were not serious,
but his appearance was ghastly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve unraveled the whole plot!&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, not heeding his captain&#8217;s inquiry.
&#8220;Mr. Impey has deliberately misrepresented
everything to us. He has fooled the Japanese
too, and they have sent Captain Inaba, or
at least Impey says so, and Taki corroborates
it, to intercept and take the Chinese war-ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers threw an anxious glance
in Sago&#8217;s direction. The steward had withdrawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to a corner of the room and was
standing with his back to the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey told us that Sago went to the
Minister of War or to some one there and told
that O&#8217;Neil had the missing secret document,&#8221;
Phil said quickly in answering his captain&#8217;s
unspoken question as to the propriety of
speaking before the steward. &#8220;We can&#8217;t
blame him though, sir,&#8221; he added generously.
&#8220;After all, his blood is Japanese, and we had
no right to the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago&#8217;s face beamed with gratitude as he
turned toward the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sago very loyal to America, captain,&#8221; the
Japanese steward exclaimed earnestly, coming
forward timidly. &#8220;Sago very much afraid
when he see the letter. Captain Inaba my old
friend. I tell him where is the letter. I very
sorry to offend my captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers looked puzzled. He glanced
hastily at his watch. &#8220;Go and get yourselves
ready,&#8221; he ordered suddenly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve less
than an hour. When I am dressed, I&#8217;ll come in
and you can tell me the whole story. I can&#8217;t
understand these fragmentary descriptions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads quietly obeyed, and once in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
own room Sydney carefully washed and
antiseptically dressed Phil&#8217;s scars of battle.
The midshipmen were struggling into their
evening uniform when the captain appeared,
looking very imposing in his gold lace and
medals.</p>

<p>The lads began at the beginning and gave
him minutely all the important information
which they had learned since their
arrival in Tokyo, and also a short account of
their differences with Lieutenant Takishima
which had ended so happily. Captain Rodgers
took Phil seriously to task for breaking the
anti-dueling rule, but he promised no further
action.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be the aim of this fellow
Impey?&#8221; Captain Rodgers said quietly after
he had admonished the lads in his severe
stern official voice. &#8220;Who will benefit by a
war between us and Japan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers sat silent, thinking deeply
while the midshipmen, assisted by the grateful
Sago, finished their toilet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a European country mixed up in
this somewhere,&#8221; he said half to himself.
&#8220;That country has a railroad in Manchuria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and is building a new road toward the valuable
mining districts of Shensi Province in
China.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney had stopped in their dressing,
and were listening eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Chinese prince was in America,
our bankers closed a loan to the Chinese government
of many millions of dollars; for this
an American syndicate received a concession
from Peking to build a railroad from Amay
through Shensi Province. This road will be
an outlet for the richest coal, iron, copper
and silver mines in China.&#8221; Captain Rodgers
again stopped and tapped the floor with his
foot, a favorite habit when he was thinking
deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;A war between the United States and
Japan, if Japan were victorious on the sea,
would make void this concession. This European
country is building without a concession
from China, in violation of China&#8217;s right to
say who shall exploit her resources. Japan
victorious, America could not build the railroad;
the vast riches of Shensi Province
would pass over the railroad of this European
country.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;What country?&#8221; Phil asked, unable to
control his curiosity longer.</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers smiled knowingly and
shrugged his epauletted shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the United States were victorious,&#8221; he
continued, without answering Phil&#8217;s question,
&#8220;then there would be another part of China
which Japan would be forced to evacuate, and
this European country would be equally well
off. Yes,&#8221; the captain added, as though convinced,
&#8220;that must be the correct diagnosis.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen had drunk in every word
of their captain&#8217;s able summing up, and now
gazed at him eager to hear more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who is Impey?&#8221; they asked almost
in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be that country&#8217;s agent,&#8221; Captain
Rodgers replied quickly, &#8220;and probably
agent also for the shipbuilding firms who
built the Chinese navy and are now wondering
where they will get their money, for
China is in the throes of internal strife. If
these ships are bought by Japan or the United
States a very fancy figure would of necessity
be paid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sago,&#8221; Captain Rodgers added, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
steward bowed low in answer, &#8220;remember
the United States wishes to be Japan&#8217;s friend.
Her interests and Japan&#8217;s are not really in
conflict. It is these interested third parties
who are forcing us to be unfriendly and
maybe to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sago bowed again and drew in his breath
sharply in sign of agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me just what was in that
letter?&#8221; the captain asked.</p>

<p>Sago hesitated several minutes, while the
three American officers waited patiently, no
sign of intimidation in their attitude toward
the uncertain Japanese.</p>

<p>&#8220;It said the United States ships in Manila
will be ordered to seize the Chinese ships.
That United States make law to keep all
Japanese out of America and the Philippine
Islands. That United States want to capture
Formosa. That United States and some European
countries want to make Japan give up
Manchuria. It then say Japan must quick
buy Chinese ships and America would be
afraid to make war because Japan then be
too strong.&#8221; Sago spoke jerkily and slowly,
selecting his words carefully while he translated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
in his mind, the characters of the secret
letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all of that misinformation came to
the Japanese through Mr. Impey and his
agents!&#8221; Captain Rodgers exclaimed angrily.
&#8220;What a wonderful imagination Impey must
have! And so the Japanese have rushed
away to take the Chinese ships to prevent
their falling into our hands. How easily an
intelligent nation&#8217;s suspicions can be aroused.
The Japanese diplomats believed that letter
was an accurate summing up of the situation,
and in reality America has not raised a hand
to acquire these vessels.</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom was this letter addressed and by
whom signed?&#8221; Captain Rodgers asked earnestly
of the steward, who seemed now only
too anxious to give all the information possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Addressed to the advisers of the Emperor
and signed by the chief officers of naval and
military services,&#8221; Sago answered unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba is their right hand man!&#8221;
Phil exclaimed. &#8220;He probably composed the
letter, and Taki said he knew the contents.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>&#8220;Only half of the secret has been unraveled,&#8221;
Captain Rodgers said thoughtfully.
&#8220;Impey took his garbled story of the letter to
our ambassador. He probably also went to
Captain Inaba with the tale that the letter
was in the hands of our sailors; Captain
Inaba has gone to seize the Chinese ships before
our fleet in Manila can intercept them.
Impey gave you this information and Takishima
has confirmed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers was silent for a few moments,
then a slight smile curved the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our ambassador sent a cable to the State
Department giving the information which
Impey brought him,&#8221; he said slowly and
thoughtfully. &#8220;The &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; claims to
have received a cable saying our government
had determined to take the Chinese ships.
I believe the cable was pure fabrication&mdash;Impey&#8217;s
imagination. Still,&#8221; he ended abruptly,
&#8220;I am puzzled to explain all of his
actions. At times he impressed me as being
honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled in a satisfied way. Had he not
suspected him from the first?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;The situation is a very grave one,&#8221; Captain
Rodgers said to the lads, after they were
in the carriage and driving rapidly through
the streets, illuminated in honor of their visit,
on their way to the American Embassy.
&#8220;When two nations mistrust each other&#8217;s
actions, the seizing of the war-ships of a
neutral and weak power like China is very
certain to precipitate a condition which will
be a step toward war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney nodded their heads in
silent understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am afraid that the ambassador and
I are quite powerless to change the situation,&#8221;
he continued thoughtfully. &#8220;The only way
possible would be to induce the Japanese
government to refrain from this seizure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Takishima said that was now impossible,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed in much perturbation, for he
had not believed the mere seizure of the
Chinese ships by Japan would lead to war.</p>

<p>Further conversation was cut short as their
carriage rolled up through the smooth driveway
to the door of the American Embassy.
The lads caught glimpses of much gold lace
as they followed their captain into the brightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
lighted hallway, where their capes and hats
were handed over to numerous attentive
servants.</p>

<p>Once in the large reception room, dazzled
by the handsomely gowned women and the
glitter of Japan&#8217;s chivalry, both military and
naval, the situation dwindled in importance.
Impey was there, and Phil caught his eye almost
immediately upon entering the room.
The lad&#8217;s face flushed and there was anger in
his heart as the part Impey was playing came
again into his mind.</p>

<p>At dinner Phil was deeply gratified to find
himself between Helen and Takishima.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is what I heard about Mr. Impey true?&#8221;
the former asked Phil in a low voice amid
the loud hum of conversation about them.
&#8220;Has he intentionally misrepresented the condition
of affairs to father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded. &#8220;Worse than that,&#8221; the lad
whispered impressively. &#8220;He is responsible
for all those articles in the &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217;
slandering Americans. He has fooled both
the Japanese and ourselves, and has brought
the two countries precious near to a war.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think it by looking about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
this table, would you?&#8221; he added in grim
humor.</p>

<p>The entire Japanese cabinet and the highest
of its naval and military officers, with the
officers of the &#8220;Alaska,&#8221; were seated there in
friendly conversation, as if no thought of the
horrors that might come had entered their
minds. Within a week, if Impey&#8217;s plans were
successful, these same people might be pitted
against each other in a terrible naval battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does father know this?&#8221; the girl asked
anxiously. &#8220;I thought of telling him what I
had overheard at that unfortunate affair between
you and Lieutenant Takishima, but I
was afraid I had not heard aright, and I was
too much agitated afterward to ask you to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell him to-night,&#8221; Phil replied,
&#8220;unless Captain Rodgers does. I have told
our captain everything except&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Phil
stopped abruptly while Helen raised her eyes
to his face in inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except what?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_300.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;EXCEPT WHAT&#8221; SHE ASKED</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; Phil began, and then after
a second&#8217;s thought he changed his mind.
Why should he not tell? Every one near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
them was busy talking and no one could possibly
overhear. &#8220;Impey said that he had an
order signed by the Wai-Wu-Pu, to turn over
the Chinese squadron to the Americans, and
wanted me to take his yacht, the &#8216;Sylvia,&#8217; and
beat the Japanese ships south. You know
that we think they have gone with Captain
Inaba to seize the Chinese squadron off
Singapore Straits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell that to father?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey assured us that your father already
knew of this letter from the Wai-Wu-Pu,&#8221;
Phil returned.</p>

<p>Before the girl could answer, her neighbor
on the other side claimed her attention, much
to Phil&#8217;s chagrin, and he unconsciously
frowned in the direction of Lieutenant Winston,
the intruder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend Impey has been watching you
very closely, Perry,&#8221; Takishima said in a low
voice as Phil turned away from Helen&#8217;s
averted face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watching us both, I imagine,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;A much colored account of our little misunderstanding
this afternoon will probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
figure prominently in the &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; to-morrow,&#8221;
he added in concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen to that,&#8221; Takishima assured him.
&#8220;The &#8216;Shimbunshi&#8217; has been suppressed by
the prime minister&#8217;s order. And all cablegrams
from the country are being censored,
and nothing can be sent in cipher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could persuade your minister
to recall Captain Inaba,&#8221; Phil urged earnestly.
&#8220;Captain Rodgers believes that if he seizes the
ships a war may still be the outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the dinner was over Phil and Sydney
maneuvered to have a quiet talk with Takishima.
A bold plan, the seed of which had
been sown in Phil&#8217;s mind by Impey&#8217;s proposal
to use the yacht, had occurred to the
midshipman. Phil was not sure the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221;
would be allowed to leave Yokohama harbor,
but a word from the Japanese lieutenant would
be enough.</p>

<p>Helen was taken into the conspiracy, and
with the three classmates quietly stole away
to a sun parlor in the back of the legation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one will find us here,&#8221; Helen whispered
breathlessly, her face showing keen
excitement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Phil, remembering Takishima&#8217;s promise to
be open and frank with him, began by asking
the question that seemed to be the most
important to clear up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have your war-ships been given orders
to prevent the sailing of the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s eyes opened in mild surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you believe that Japan would
be so impolite?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Who is responsible
for such a rumor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey, of course,&#8221; Phil returned, smilingly,
&#8220;the source of all our misinformation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Phil persisted, &#8220;if the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;
should leave now and send a wireless to the
American fleet in Manila to take the Chinese
ships, Captain Inaba&#8217;s mission would fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima was thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should not stop the &#8216;Alaska,&#8217;&#8221; he
said decidedly. &#8220;What steps our Minister of
Marine would take afterward I cannot say, but
of course you know we would take all steps
possible to insure Captain Inaba&#8217;s success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were sure America did not want
the Chinese ships, your minister would be
willing to have Captain Inaba fail, wouldn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; Phil asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; Takishima answered without
a moment&#8217;s hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey, as the agent of the builders of
these ships, desires them to go to either the
United States or Japan.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Captain Rodgers&#8217; opinion,&#8221; Phil
continued. &#8220;The ships were built for China,
but as yet not paid for. Impey declares he
has in his pocket an order from the Chinese
council for the throne, the great Wai-Wu-Pu,
to turn the ships over to the American government.
If he were not the agent how could
he get such an order?&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima shook his head in sign of
mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot we manage to prevent either nation
from getting them?&#8221; the midshipman
asked excitedly. &#8220;Then all would be settled
amicably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could we do the impossible?&#8221; Takishima
asked, his dark eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get this order from Impey. Use the
&#8216;Sylvia&#8217; and take the Chinese ships into
Manila Bay,&#8221; Phil replied quickly. &#8220;Our
admiral would look out for them and convey
them back to China.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>Takishima drew himself up stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;That
I should betray my country, and deliver the
ships into your admiral&#8217;s hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil in his earnestness had certainly made
a blunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil means to put the Chinese ships out
of the reach of both nations,&#8221; Sydney hastened
to explain, and Phil nodded gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see how that can be done,&#8221; Takishima
replied, after several minutes&#8217; thought.
&#8220;I am very sorry, but as a Japanese naval
officer I cannot take any action that would
defeat the aim of the Emperor. His Majesty
has made his decision; that decision cannot
be changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you refuse to help us to avert this
war!&#8221; Phil exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing else honorable for me to
do,&#8221; Takishima answered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>A BOLD PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen returned to their hotel in
despair at the outcome of their plans to save
a delicate situation.</p>

<p>They had been in their room but a few
minutes before there was a knock on their
door and Robert Impey entered.</p>

<p>Both lads looked up in annoyed surprise,
for they had studiously avoided him at the
embassy and had showed in their manner
that the kindly feeling which they had entertained
for him earlier had received a distinct
check.</p>

<p>The foreigner refused to be put aside by
this evident coolness, but sat down in a vacant
chair, gazing boldly at his accusers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you have dug up the corpse,&#8221; he said,
an ugly smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Phil hastened to reply, &#8220;we&#8217;ve
learned of your two-faced dealings, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
be greatly obliged if you close the door from
the outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Softly, Mr. Perry,&#8221; Impey returned boldly.
&#8220;I can be of use to you yet, and at the same
time serve my own ends. You see,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I can now be entirely honest with
you, because you have found out my secrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can never trust you,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;I think, Phil, it&#8217;s best for us to
have nothing to do with this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have but a short time to tell you what
you can do, if you will agree, because I fear a
warrant will be out for my arrest before midnight,
but by then I hope to be on board the
&#8216;Alaska.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil waved his hand patiently for Impey to
continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the order from the Wai-Wu-Pu.
It&#8217;s in Chinese, and will be honored by the
Chinese admiral.&#8221; Impey drew an official
document from his pocket and placed it on
the table before him. &#8220;The &#8216;Sylvia&#8217; is there
with steam up and bunkers full of coal. She
is faster than anything in Japan but a torpedo
boat, or destroyer. If you slip out during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
night you can get safely away, and no one will
guess her mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil heard Captain Rodgers&#8217; step in the hall
and then heard his door close. Excusing
himself hastily and bidding Sydney to detain
Impey, he knocked and went into the captain&#8217;s
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon my abruptness, sir,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;but there is a serious matter which I want
you to decide for us to-night.&#8221; Then he detailed
calmly but quickly everything that had
been learned since their consultation in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will give Mr. Monroe and me indefinite
leave, I believe we can without international
complications prevent the Japanese
from seizing the Chinese ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Rodgers&#8217; eyes opened in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, sir, just how it can be
done, but we shall go in the yacht &#8216;Sylvia,&#8217;&#8221;
he added eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; Captain Rodgers exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the chance. Go by all means, and
you had best take O&#8217;Neil with you; he&#8217;s a
handy man to have in such an expedition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
He and Marley were waiting to see you on the
driveway as I came in. Take both of them,
and don&#8217;t get us farther involved in this international
muddle than we are already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thanked his captain and shook his hand
warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have warned the ambassador about
Impey,&#8221; Captain Rodgers added. &#8220;It seems
he has been completely taken in by the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have wired the President of the United
States asking to be allowed to give his letter to
the Minister of State. I was instructed, as you
know, to deliver it only into the hands of the
Emperor. I am sure if that letter were read
by the Japanese government that Captain
Inaba would be recalled by wireless.&#8221;</p>

<p>After leaving the captain&#8217;s room Phil went at
once to where O&#8217;Neil and Marley were waiting.
Taking the boatswain&#8217;s mate aside, he gave
him hurried but detailed instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can depend on us, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered,
quite calmly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all be on board
the yacht when you arrive. It looks like
ugly weather, sir,&#8221; he added glancing aloft at
the scudding clouds. &#8220;The Japs won&#8217;t be
keeping much of a watch to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>Phil went back to his room, much pleased
with his success.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that this would serve your end
too?&#8221; Phil asked Impey, as he arose to go
after giving the midshipman a letter to the
captain of the yacht, and the official document
that would turn over the Chinese ships to the
American navy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States is a better paymaster
than Japan,&#8221; Impey replied again seating
himself coolly, &#8220;and we&#8217;d rather have your
country to deal with in China than the Japanese.
Whichever nation gets the ships, war
will be certain, and if the United States is successful
Japan will cease to be a factor in the
Orient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey arose again to go while the midshipmen
regarded him in blank surprise. They
could not help admiring the man&#8217;s self-possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not offer to shake hands,&#8221; he said
with a cynical smile of satisfaction at the
success of his proposal. &#8220;We need not consider
ourselves under the slightest obligation
to each other. The expenses of the yacht will
be paid by my syndicate through the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
of the &#8216;Sylvia.&#8217; And now I wish you success
as I wish it for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed after him while Phil and
Sydney sat gazing stupidly at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the cast-iron nerves,&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed, after he had collected his scattered
wits. &#8220;Did you hear him speak of his syndicate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Rodgers judged the man rightly
this afternoon,&#8221; Phil replied gravely. &#8220;He
represents moneyed interests in Europe which
are anxious to see the United States and
Japan clash in a struggle which would leave
both nations prostrated both physically and
financially, and then the European vultures
could come and pick the bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had already commenced to pack
up his clothes into his valises and Phil
quickly followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No time should be lost, Phil,&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and order the carriage
and get the porter.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later the two lads bade farewell to the
ambassador and his daughter. Phil told him
of their mission and the ambassador listened
with open admiration at the daring of the plan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>&#8220;The situation is very acute,&#8221; Mr. Tillotson
said soberly. &#8220;The yellow journals in
America are arousing the country to war.
They insist that in refusing the audience to
Captain Rodgers with the Emperor, our
country has been grossly insulted, and this
has been reported throughout the land. The
studied secrecy of Japan has quite upset
America. They don&#8217;t know what to believe.
If you are successful I hope our countrymen
may again find their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this all in the Japanese papers?&#8221; Phil
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No mention is made in any paper in
Japan. The people have been kept in ignorance
of the sudden wave of dislike that has
gone over the continent of America, but I
have my information this time from a reliable
source, no less a person than the prime
minister himself, who has received the information
from America. He called to tell me
of the censorship, and that for the present
all cipher messages would be held up. He
was greatly surprised that the refusal of the
audience was known in America since all
messages were stopped. I tried to persuade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
him to recall Captain Inaba, assuring him
that the United States did not desire to have
the Chinese battle-ships, but my efforts were
in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he surprised to know that you had
been informed of Captain Inaba&#8217;s mission?&#8221;
Phil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said nothing to show his surprise,&#8221;
the ambassador answered gravely, &#8220;and I
can never read the faces of these Japanese
diplomats. They seem to be able to hide all
emotion; but he knows of Impey&#8217;s treachery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was grateful to Sydney for engaging
the ambassador in conversation while he said
good-bye to Helen. The night was warm,
and the two walked slowly along the gravel
path within the embassy enclosure.</p>

<p>He told her of their mission, but scoffed at
any idea of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole thing depends upon our
getting away without being discovered,&#8221; he
told her excitedly. &#8220;You see, Taki knows
that we would like to prevent Captain Inaba&#8217;s
mission being successful, and the yacht is
being watched by the Japanese battle-ships.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;I wish I were a man,&#8221; Helen exclaimed,
glancing proudly at Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; he asked smiling
happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go with you instead of staying behind
and worrying,&#8221; she replied decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not be gone long,&#8221; he said
hurriedly, trying to appear unconcerned,
&#8220;and when we return I hope there will be
no more cause for worry. Japan and the
United States will become firmer friends than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Helen,&#8221; he added, her hand
in his. &#8220;It&#8217;s beastly to have to leave Japan
just when we were having such a good
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was conscious of her ready sympathy
and of a wistful look in her eyes as she bade
him good-bye.</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and the ambassador
and Sydney stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just coming for you,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;Phil has no idea of time, you
know,&#8221; he added pointedly to the ambassador,
who chuckled at the discomfiture of
the pair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;The Chinese ambassador was here this
morning, and gave me this letter. He is
very much disappointed at the thought of
his friend Admiral Ting losing his command.&#8221;
Mr. Tillotson as he spoke placed in
Phil&#8217;s hand a large official document. The
lad saw it was heavy and glanced inquiringly
at the ambassador.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter is inside, in its own envelope.
My explanatory letter is there also. If you
are in danger of capture destroy it, for it
might cause much unpleasantness. Of course,&#8221;
the ambassador added, &#8220;the Chinese ambassador
knows nothing of the later developments
in the case&mdash;only what I have told
him, that America would like to be sure that
the Chinese navy remains in China&#8217;s keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil placed the letter carefully within his
pocket, and took the outstretched hand of
Mr. Tillotson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to welcome you back within a
fortnight,&#8221; the latter said in an attempt to
appear cheerful. &#8220;We shall miss you very
much,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>And then the carriage was off. The midshipmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
waved their hands until the horses
turned out through the gate, and the two
figures became hidden behind the high wall
of the enclosure.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight before they arrived
in Yokohama, but the ever-faithful O&#8217;Neil
was awaiting them at the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey is waiting there in the launch,&#8221;
the boatswain&#8217;s mate explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s dressed
in one of my uniforms. The Japanese policemen
are close on his trail. He seems very
anxious to get to the &#8216;Alaska,&#8217;&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The midshipmen allowed O&#8217;Neil to relieve
them of their valises, and entered the
&#8220;Alaska&#8217;s&#8221; steam launch. They could hardly
suppress a smile as they saw the discomfited
Impey disguised in the uniform of an American
sailorman.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the &#8216;Sylvia&#8217; first,&#8221; Phil ordered, after
they had cleared the dock, and the launch,
pitching lightly in the rising sea, steamed
rapidly out toward the lights of the anchored
ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to come aboard and explain
to your captain,&#8221; Phil said quietly as they
reached the gangway of the yacht.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>They followed Impey up the ladder, while
O&#8217;Neil and Marley, with the valises, brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>The storm predicted by O&#8217;Neil seemed about
to be realized. The wind was steadily increasing,
and a shower of rain came swiftly
out of the night, shutting the launch off completely
from the surrounding vessels.</p>

<p>Phil laid his hand impulsively upon Impey&#8217;s
arm to detain him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go with us,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;We
cannot appear in this except as passengers.
We are all armed, you see,&#8221; he added, his
revolver, which O&#8217;Neil had brought him,
shining in his hand. &#8220;We are in deadly
earnest, Mr. Impey,&#8221; advancing his gun so
that the yacht owner could see it, &#8220;and your
two conspirators are both with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey started perceptibly, and a look of
fear came into his eyes, but the boldness of
the midshipmen reassured him. With such
men in command the expedition could hardly
fail, and at all events he would be safely out
of the reach of Japanese law.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must sail at once!&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
glancing into the heavy mist which had shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
down over the bay. His hand still clasped
Impey&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will, then,&#8221; the latter replied.</p>

<p>The lads followed Impey to the bridge,
where Captain Bailey, the yacht&#8217;s sailing-master,
was awaiting orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;These gentlemen will give you instructions,
captain,&#8221; Impey ordered in a nervous
voice, glancing at the dim hull of a Japanese
ship scarcely a stone&#8217;s throw away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get under way as quietly as possible,&#8221;
Phil said eagerly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t start to heave the
anchor chain in until the next rain squall.
We want all speed possible. And steer for
the entrance to the bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Bailey gave a silent nod of understanding,
showing no apparent surprise at the
dress of his employer or at the order directing
him to take instructions from these two
young naval men. His salary was large, and
he thoroughly understood that he was expected
to ask no questions.</p>

<p>While the midshipmen waited anxiously
on the bridge, a sudden rain squall enveloped
them. They heard, through the roar of the
wind, a dull clanking of chain and immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
afterward a tremor shook the lightly-built
yacht as the anchor let go its grip upon
the harbor mud, and the triple engines were
sent ahead at full speed. Phil peered through
the driving rain in the direction where he
knew the Japanese battle-ships were anchored.
He could see their lights flickering dimly,
and hoped that O&#8217;Neil was correct, and that
a strict watch was not being kept. With
rapidly beating hearts the two lads watched
the lights dissolve in the darkness, while the
little yacht cut swiftly through the troubled
waters, throwing a shower of salty spray all
about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t seen us yet,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in a much relieved whisper, and they
were about to leave the bridge and seek shelter
in the comfortable cabin below when from the
gloom behind them a bright shaft of light appeared,
and a dull boom of a gun awoke the
echoes within the harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep going, captain,&#8221; Phil commanded
hoarsely, &#8220;even if they try to sink us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can trust to me, young man,&#8221; Captain
Bailey returned gruffly. &#8220;I am not anxious to
sleep in a Japanese jail.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>The search-light made all possible effort to
pierce the murky atmosphere, but failed dismally,
and as they watched it, the bright light
suddenly went out.</p>

<p>But as the midshipmen, drenched to the
skin, were seeking shelter below, Sydney laid
an excited hand on Phil&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he said, and as he spoke, a
rocket of warning soared high above the
anchored war-ships.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>ON THE HIGH SEAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Around</span> the table in the saloon cabin were
an incongruous group as the two midshipmen
entered. Phil smiled at the sight of Impey in
his sailor uniform. There were two strange
faces beside O&#8217;Neil and Marley; the latter
men had risen respectfully upon the entrance
of the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey&#8217;s friends,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil introduced
them with a wave of his hand toward Wells
and Randall.</p>

<p>Phil inclined his head, while the men
thus unceremoniously presented looked half
ashamed at being so designated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all in for it,&#8221; Phil said bravely.
&#8220;We were discovered by the Japanese battle-ships
and will surely be chased by a torpedo
boat. If we are overtaken before we clear the
bay we&#8217;ll be brought back to Yokohama.</p>

<p>&#8220;To us that will mean only a failure to
thwart the aims of the Japanese,&#8221; he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
&#8220;but for Mr. Impey and his friends something
more serious will be in store.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s face appeared pale and worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can do nothing to me,&#8221; he exclaimed,
striving to show a bold front. &#8220;They
can deport me, but I am quite ready to leave
Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the penalty, under the
Japanese law, for breaking the Emperor&#8217;s
seal?&#8221; Phil asked cruelly. &#8220;It&#8217;s five years in
prison. How the Japanese lieutenant came to
permit your two assistants to remain here, I
can&#8217;t understand, unless they thought they&#8217;d
be within easy reach. I shall take great
pleasure in testifying against the lot of you,
unless,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you stand by us and do
all in your power to help us elude the vessel
that soon will be in chase of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipman waited quietly for an
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can count on Wells and me,&#8221; Randall
returned promptly. &#8220;I am in no mood to be
introduced to a Japanese prison and a rice
diet. If I can shake off the dust of this country
nothing less than a Broadway beefsteak
will suit me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>Wells nodded his head and raised a hand
in agreement with his companion&#8217;s views.
Phil&#8217;s eyes were on Impey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see why you wanted me to go with
you,&#8221; Impey said finally, in a petulant
voice. &#8220;I offered you the yacht and gave
you the permit from the Chinese cabinet. Of
what further assistance can I be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the sense of taking only a
paper permit when the living permit in the
person of the agent for the builders of the
ships was available,&#8221; he replied pointedly.
&#8220;However, if you all will agree to obey me
implicitly in everything and ask no questions,
we shall elude the Japanese. If you don&#8217;t
agree, then down you go under lock and key
in one of the cabins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s lip quivered irritably as he reluctantly
gave an assent to Phil&#8217;s proposal.
His subtle mind was attempting to solve what
the midshipmen&#8217;s intentions might be. Nothing
less, he decided, than to checkmate Captain
Inaba and win the Chinese ships for the
United States fleet&mdash;the course he himself had
already outlined.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was now tearing through the
troubled waters of the bay at almost railroad
speed. Her three turbine shafts were revolving
at a far greater speed than they ever had
before. The Chinese crew in the fire-room
were told that their own lives depended upon
the outcome of the race&mdash;that their old enemies
the Japanese were chasing them. Their
Oriental minds could not grasp the lack of
logic in the warning. They knew that they
had been hired for hazardous work, and were
being paid a larger salary than they could get
anywhere else in the Orient.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we can all safely turn in,&#8221; Phil
suggested, after O&#8217;Neil had returned from a
tour of inspection with a report that everything
was going finely, and that it was too
thick to see more than a mile astern. &#8220;If
they send a destroyer after us, it can&#8217;t overtake
us until the morning. It will be a race
of wits,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and not of speed, if a
destroyer once gets us in sight, so sleep is what
we need to clear our minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yacht had staterooms for the entire
party, and Phil after a short conversation with
Captain Bailey, who stuck manfully to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
bridge, where he said he would remain all
night and would call &#8220;all hands&#8221; if necessary,
lay down in his clothes with a blanket
drawn over him and was almost immediately
asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had only dozed when a
sharp discharge as of a gun awakened him.
Quickly jumping up he ran out on deck. A
bright flashing search-light was visible on the
port beam, and Phil&#8217;s heart was in his mouth
as he saw a flash of fire and heard the whistle
of a shell.</p>

<p>&#8220;The forts,&#8221; he cried in alarm. &#8220;They
have been notified to stop us.&#8221; He glanced
anxiously at the weather. The rain had
ceased, and the wind had fallen light, but the
air was misty and warmer. The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was
rushing by the nearest fort at the speed of an
express train. The search-light was now shining
on the black hull, and flash after flash
told that the fort was in earnest. Phil
found his way to the bridge, passing an excited
group of frightened Chinese crewmen on
his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hitting pretty close, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed as a hissing shell threw a shower of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
salty spray over the speeding yacht. The
boatswain&#8217;s mate spoke in a low tone to Captain
Bailey, and then quickly disappeared
from the bridge, followed by the faithful
Marley.</p>

<p>It seemed to the two midshipmen, now
standing side by side, entirely exposed to the
terrific cannonading, that the next minute
must be the yacht&#8217;s last. Then, as if by command,
the firing ceased, but the search-lights,
now three in number, illuminated the
&#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; trim hull from bow to stern.
The fort had drawn aft to the quarter and the
range was ever increasing. The point of
greatest danger was passed. But what was
the meaning of the sudden cessation of fire?</p>

<p>A cry from Sydney caused Phil to glance
astern, expecting yet dreading to see the low
olive green hull of a destroyer loom out of the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried in alarm.</p>

<p>Sydney silently pointed; there at the peak
floated a large American flag. Then that
alone had caused the Japanese to stop their
cannonade! Phil was about to order it down,
but quicker almost than it takes to tell it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
fort disappeared in the mist and the flag
fluttered down to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;That flag certainly talks, Bill,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said
as the two men walked quietly back to the
bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize what you&#8217;ve done?&#8221; Phil
exclaimed after O&#8217;Neil had informed them
that he had hoisted the colors. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
advertised that American naval officers are
running this yacht. With the present tension
between Japan and the United States that flag
made the Japanese army officers in the forts
hesitate. They thought it might mean war,
so they stopped firing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil returned
quickly, &#8220;but if I hadn&#8217;t hoisted it, or hoisted
any other flag, we would have all been swimming
for the shore by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will only be a matter of hours now before
destroyers will be hunting us from every
naval port in Japan,&#8221; Phil said disappointedly,
as he started again for his cabin and more
sleep.</p>

<p>The morning dawned gray and cheerless.
The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was steadily steaming to the
southward. Great drifts of fog were frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
encountered through which the yacht plunged
to emerge again into the semi-misty atmosphere
surrounding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard them talking last night, sir,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil announced after breakfast. &#8220;I was
listening in the wireless room almost all night.
Bill Marley and I took down some of the
messages, but we can&#8217;t read Japanese,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Japanese navy uses our letters, but
doubtless their messages are in cipher,&#8221; Phil
returned as he took the penciled records from
O&#8217;Neil, glancing at them carelessly. Impey
stood near by apparently much interested.
The lad handed the papers to him, a questioning
look in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t read them,&#8221; Impey said after a
minute&#8217;s study. &#8220;Hello, here&#8217;s one not in
cipher,&#8221; he exclaimed, scanning a sheet more
closely.</p>

<p>The midshipmen waited impatiently. Phil
could barely suppress a doubting smile as
there came into his thoughts the garbled
manner in which Impey had given the
ambassador the contents of the lost document.
Could they depend now upon his rendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
of this mysterious aerial message? Impey
again scanned the paper, apparently in deep
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;My knowledge of Japanese is limited,&#8221;
he said finally, his eyes still on the paper.
&#8220;But roughly this message directs that all
vessels in this vicinity search for us and
hold us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded his head. There was no harm
in believing that.</p>

<p>Steadily the yacht reeled off the miles
over a sea that was becoming smoother now
every hour. The air had become heavier and
the rifts of fog were being encountered more
frequently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a forlorn hope, Syd,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
sorrowfully as the two leaned over
the after rail, their eyes on the horizon to
the north. &#8220;We are probably making twenty-three
knots an hour, but a destroyer is good
for at least thirty. I am afraid we were too
hasty in our plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney was silent. Far astern above the
low fog a dark smudge had caught his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke!&#8221; he cried out dejectedly. &#8220;If
the fog would only shut in to stay!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>Phil called for a spy-glass, and looked long
and eagerly at the dark mass hanging above
a distant fog bank. The sailors and Impey,
seeing that something was in the wind, had
joined the lads, and all eyes were peering at
the dreaded signs of a chasing vessel.</p>

<p>They were not left long in doubt. From
out of the mass of fog bank a dark speck
suddenly became visible, and before their
eyes it grew until a four funneled destroyer
stood clearly outlined. A white line of foam
at its bow told of its great speed, and it was
heading directly for the yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an end to all our hopes,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed sadly. &#8220;We can&#8217;t fight her, for
we have no guns, and if we fought and lost
they could treat us as pirates and swing us at
the yard-arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flash from the bow of the destroyer
followed by a hissing splash astern told of
the newcomer&#8217;s invitation to &#8220;heave to&#8221; and
&#8220;be spoken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, tell Captain Bailey to stop and
wait,&#8221; Phil ordered dejectedly. &#8220;We can&#8217;t
afford to run risks. These Japanese know
how to shoot, I am told.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; very soon lay dead in the
water, steam pouring from her escape pipes,
while a gangway was quickly rigged and the
midshipmen stood ready to meet the officer
who they knew would soon pay them a visit.</p>

<p>The destroyer drew rapidly up on the
motionless vessel, and was soon stopped alongside,
rolling deeply in the swell, scarcely a
hundred yards away. Phil with rapidly
beating heart saw a small dinghy dropped
from the destroyer&#8217;s boat davit and, with an
officer in the stern sheets, pull quickly alongside
the yacht&#8217;s gangway.</p>

<p>His face fell as he saw the officer was no
other than Lieutenant Takishima. Here
were more complications. Takishima knew
only too accurately the midshipmen&#8217;s plans,
for had they not invited him to share them?</p>

<p>The midshipmen were in civilian&#8217;s clothes,
and Takishima with a studied official manner
looked past them seeking some one in authority
to whom he might address himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to inconvenience you,&#8221; he
said, his eyes on Impey, the one whom he
took to be in authority. &#8220;My orders are to
convey you back to Yokohama. You sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
without clearing from the port authorities,
and you refused to stop when challenged by
the forts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are on the high seas,&#8221; Impey replied
quickly. &#8220;You have no right to detain us.
By the law of nations except in time of war
that flag protects us from such a high-handed
proceeding.&#8221; He pointed to the British ensign,
which had been run up to the gaff when
the destroyer was first sighted.</p>

<p>Takishima glanced aloft and a sphinx-like
smile appeared upon his upturned face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night you flew a different one,&#8221; he
said calmly. &#8220;Are you under the protection
of both governments? Maybe between times
you carry the black flag of a pirate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey bit his lips, at loss for an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a mistake,&#8221; he replied hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Phil had from a distance observed his Japanese
friend. After he had ignored the midshipmen&#8217;s
presence and addressed himself to
Impey, the lad had backed away, but kept
just within ear-shot. He saw that Takishima
was armed with a revolver, and knew that
each man of the waiting boat&#8217;s crew also was
armed. The destroyer had now ranged close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
alongside, and he could read the interest in
the faces of its crew, so close was it. The
mist was beginning slowly to shut down; a
warm south wind had sprung up, and in
contact with the cold sea-water was giving
up its moisture in fog. O&#8217;Neil stood at the
gangway, the boat-line in his hand to which
the small boat was holding. There seemed
no possible loophole of escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall put some of our sailors on board,&#8221;
Takishima said, turning toward the gangway,
and then for the first time addressing Phil.
&#8220;Will you come back with me to the destroyer
&#8216;Hatsuke&#8217;? I can land you somewhere, and
you and your friends can return to Yokohama
by train without publicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears of mortification stood in Phil&#8217;s eyes.
His plans had miscarried. He bowed his acknowledgment
to Takishima for his consideration.
In being landed he and his companions
would escape the disgrace of returning in the
seized &#8220;Sylvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima raised his voice and hailed the
&#8220;Hatsuke.&#8221; An answer quickly came back,
and the water was churned to foam as the
destroyer shot ahead, turning with port helm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Phil understood that Takishima had ordered
the officer in command to come alongside the
yacht in order to transfer passengers. While
all eyes watched the graceful lines of the
fleet craft, suddenly, as if a curtain had been
dropped, the &#8220;Hatsuke&#8221; dissolved from sight.
Acting upon an impulse as daring as it was
sudden, Phil grasped the duplicate engine
telegraph near the mainmast, and rang up
full speed ahead. No word was spoken, but
as the yacht forged ahead, O&#8217;Neil threw overboard
the life-line to which Takishima&#8217;s boat
was made fast. The men in the boat gazed
up in startled surprise, but O&#8217;Neil waved his
hand in the direction the destroyer had disappeared,
and almost at once the boat had
drifted astern and out of sight in the fog.</p>

<p>Takishima was completely taken by surprise.
His hand went quickly to his revolver,
but Sydney&#8217;s iron grip on his wrist prevented
him from drawing it from its holster, while
Phil&#8217;s revolver peered into his angered face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our turn now, Taki; be game!&#8221; Phil
exclaimed. &#8220;This gun isn&#8217;t loaded, and I
wouldn&#8217;t shoot you if it were. It&#8217;s only a
figure of speech; but if you try to draw I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
wrestle you for your gun, and I am a lot
bigger than you are and have a few friends
to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima wrenched himself angrily away,
and the next minute his brightly polished
revolver was held at Phil&#8217;s head, and it was
only too plain from the light in his eyes that
he would not hesitate to use it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>THE &#8220;HATSUKE&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> suddenly, without a word being said,
Takishima slowly lowered his gun and placed
it back in its holster, and then hastily left the
group, walking silently aft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out he doesn&#8217;t commit suicide or
jump overboard, Syd!&#8221; Phil exclaimed with
a sigh of relief, as he made his way swiftly to
the bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way are you going?&#8221; he inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty nearly straight back,&#8221; Captain
Bailey replied quickly. &#8220;She&#8217;ll look for us
farther along on our old course. If the fog
holds for another hour she&#8217;ll never see us
again. I am going to run close down inside
the islands, and when we see the northern
island of the Philippines then we can shape
our course wherever you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipman nodded approvingly. Captain
Bailey knew what he was about. Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
talked a short time longer, telling of how
they had turned the tables on the unsuspecting
Japanese lieutenant, and then went aft to
look up Takishima and endeavor to console
him. He came upon him sitting disconsolate
in a chair abaft the mainmast; Sydney stood
near, but from appearances there had been
no communication between the two former
friends. Phil was on the point of joining
them when he saw that O&#8217;Neil and Marley
were waiting to speak to him, so he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; he asked
anxiously. &#8220;No strike below, I hope; if there
is we&#8217;ll all have to go down and shovel coal.
If we are caught now we can be truly called
pirates. Did you ever want to be a pirate,
Marley?&#8221; he asked jestingly.</p>

<p>The sailor turned red and stammered out
something which Phil did not see the necessity
of understanding whether his answer were yes
or no.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill and I have been thinking, sir, how we
might improve on the looks of this here yacht,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil answered importantly.</p>

<p>Phil caught the idea at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, O&#8217;Neil!&#8221; he exclaimed admiringly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
&#8220;You can do anything except cut
down her speed; but what do you propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor cast his eye knowingly about
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he replied thoughtfully, &#8220;she&#8217;s
black now; a coat of white paint wouldn&#8217;t be
amiss, and a little fancy painting on the smoke-stacks
and mast might hide the fact that she&#8217;s
a yacht. All this bright brass can be painted
too. If you say the word,&#8221; he added, &#8220;me
and Bill with those pen-pushers of Mr. Impey&#8217;s
can start in at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right ahead,&#8221; Phil said offhand. &#8220;I
am sure Mr. Impey is willing, and if he happens
not to be we won&#8217;t ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil saluted, and he and Marley went off
to find material and men to help carry out his
designs, while Phil continued on down the
deck to where Takishima was seated.</p>

<p>He laid his hand affectionately upon the
lieutenant&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, Taki, how sorry I am that
we had to play this trick on you,&#8221; he said in a
low earnest voice, &#8220;but it&#8217;s better that we
should be simply not friends than real enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima raised a haggard face to that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the midshipman. Phil saw that his humiliation
was great, and his heart smote him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be the laughing stock of our navy,&#8221;
Takishima complained bitterly. &#8220;I have disgraced
the Emperor&#8217;s uniform. My father
will disown me when he hears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taki,&#8221; Phil exclaimed earnestly, &#8220;if my
plans are successful, you will receive the thanks
of your Emperor and retain the admiration of
your brother officers in the navy, for we shall
show them how terribly they have blundered
in misunderstanding the friendly intentions of
my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Takishima&#8217;s mortification was too fresh
to be appeased by such an optimistic view of
his present predicament. Following the midshipmen
to Yokohama, he had witnessed their
escape in the yacht. He had been sent on his
own request upon this important mission&mdash;to
overtake and bring back the yacht which he
knew would endeavor to thwart Captain
Inaba&#8217;s purpose. He had not taken proper
precautions. He had discounted the daring
of his former classmates and they had turned
the trick upon him and were carrying him
away against his will while the fast &#8220;Hatsuke&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
was somewhere in the fog, searching vainly
for the swiftly escaping yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had not come on board,&#8221; Phil continued
earnestly, &#8220;it was my intention to
communicate with our admiral in Manila; tell
him of Captain Inaba&#8217;s mission and await his
instructions as to where we should meet him,
for I am sure he would endeavor to prevent
the Chinese squadron from being seized. By
Japan&#8217;s holding up all cablegrams from Captain
Rodgers and our ambassador and refusing
to deliver those arriving for them, Washington
must now suspect that your country intends to
take some action which might jeopardize the
balance of power in the Orient. Impey has
kept the Washington authorities informed
through his agents in the United States. My
wireless message will clear up the situation,
and our admiral will at once put to sea to
seize the Chinese ships himself to prevent
their falling into other hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Impey&#8217;s desire, and the reason why
he has given us the yacht. He and those for
whom he is only an agent do not desire to see
Japan grow stronger. They wish to destroy
her influence in Manchuria and in all China;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
to seal up her natural energies in the island
kingdom. America is vastly rich in resources,
and for many years to come will not care to
more than break ground in China. Meanwhile
those who pretend to be your friends are
striving to blind Japan into believing that
America covets her territory and power in
the far East, and thus tempt her to waste her
energies and wealth in a fruitless war with my
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima had listened impatiently at first,
but as Phil drove home one self-evident truth
after another, the young naval man at length
listened eagerly, understanding growing in
his troubled face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, I believe my country has been
fooled,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly. &#8220;We have
listened to a voice that we should have known
can never be disinterested. Do you know,&#8221;
he asked earnestly, &#8220;who in Japan has been
urging us to obtain the Chinese ships?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impey, of course,&#8221; Phil answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but his urging has been done in a
different way,&#8221; Takishima continued. &#8220;He
has furnished the stories of what the United
States was doing and at the same time has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
subtly advised us to buy the ships if we really
wanted them. He has been the auctioneer,
knocking them down to the highest bidder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To both bidders,&#8221; Phil corrected with a
grim smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who is back of it in Japan,&#8221;
Takishima went on, not noticing the interruption,
&#8220;is Baron Kosuba, the owner and
president of the Koko Kisen Khaisha, the
biggest steamship company in Japan. It is
he who has advanced the securities in payment
for the Chinese ships, and it was he who
persuaded the Minister of State to refuse the
Emperor&#8217;s audience to your captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have had some very good
reasons,&#8221; Phil declared, &#8220;to wish to precipitate
a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry, we trained military and naval
men are but infants in diplomacy compared
to these multi-millionaires. Gold was Baron
Kosuba&#8217;s reason, and to him that was sufficient.
What does he care for the sufferings of the
people? A war in which Japan was victorious
would mean that we would be masters
of the Pacific, and the Koko Kisen Khaisha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
would send her steamers everywhere. It
would mean millions of dollars to the
baron.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you now propose to do?&#8221;
Takishima asked eagerly, after several minutes
of silence, while the two gazed out upon
the thick enveloping fog.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you now, Taki,&#8221; he replied in
a very friendly tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s too far off yet.
We&#8217;ve many dangers to pass before we can
be in touch with Manila; but,&#8221; he suddenly
asked earnestly, &#8220;will you give me your
word as a Japanese fighting man that you
will not do us damage of any kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima started perceptibly, while the
color mounted to his sallow cheeks. He had
been, even at that moment, revolving in his
mind how he could bring the yacht&#8217;s mission
to a disastrous end. It was in his thoughts
to endeavor to sink her by opening some sea
valve, even though he lost his own life in so
doing.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s keen eye noted the hesitancy in
Takishima&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;If not, Taki, as much as I would regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
it,&#8221; he said calmly, &#8220;we would lock you in
your stateroom and put a sentry over it to
prevent your getting out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima remained in deep thought for
several minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot give you my word,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;I might not be able to keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; was all Phil said as he walked
away to give the disagreeable orders for Takishima&#8217;s
confinement.</p>

<p>During the next two days the two American
sailors with Randall and Wells and all the
Chinese deck hands were busy changing the
outside appearance of the yacht. When it
was all finished the two midshipmen surveyed
the effect in wonder; the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; had been
quite obliterated, and in her place there was
a white gunboat. The shape of the deck
houses had been concealed with painted
canvas, with cleverly painted open gun
ports and guns protruding. Fighting tops
had been built on the masts and the top of
the lofty spars had been sacrificed. In every
respect, even to the bow and stern guns which
they had discovered hidden away in the hold
of the vessel, the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
counterpart of one of the small gunboats
owned by many nations for tropical service.</p>

<p>The lads were loud in their praise for the
sailors&#8217; handicraft, and Bill Marley received
his share with his usual silent smile of
pleasure.</p>

<p>Takishima, after refusing the offer made to
him, went to his stateroom, and Phil, true to
his word, after again endeavoring to extract
a promise from the obdurate Japanese, turned
the key in the lock and gave it over to the
keeping of Marley, who was to be the jailer.</p>

<p>Impey kept to himself. The midshipmen
did not encourage more friendly relations, and
he was apparently man of the world enough
to see that they did not desire him at their
councils.</p>

<p>The fog still held, and the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was
making her best speed through the almost
calm water. Phil and Sydney had thrown
themselves down in steamer chairs on the
after-deck, while O&#8217;Neil and Impey&#8217;s assistants
were casually conversing near by but out of
ear-shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Inaba and his ships must be
nearly down to Formosa by this time,&#8221; Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
said thoughtfully. &#8220;And if so he will soon
be trying to get the Chinese squadron by
wireless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By to-morrow night if the Chinese ships
are near Singapore, he might possibly get
them,&#8221; Sydney replied after a few minutes of
thought upon the distances. &#8220;To-morrow we
shall be within talking distance of the shore
stations in Luzon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded his agreement with his companion&#8217;s
calculations.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I can be sure that I am far enough
ahead of Captain Inaba,&#8221; Phil declared earnestly,
&#8220;I shall not try to call up our admiral,
but steer for Singapore Straits direct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking over this plan for
some time, Syd,&#8221; he continued quickly. &#8220;You
see, if we wire our admiral and he starts out
with the fleet he might run afoul of Captain
Inaba.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can you be sure as to where
Captain Inaba and the Japanese fleet are?&#8221;
Sydney asked, much mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only by running some risks, endeavoring
to sight them and count the ships, and find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
out the speed they are making,&#8221; Phil replied;
&#8220;and if by bad luck we are chased by a vessel
faster than we are, then maybe O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s work
may help us to make them think that we are
only a harmless gunboat, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That certainly sounds like a very dangerous
plan,&#8221; he said, shaking his head doubtfully,
&#8220;but go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are sure to arrive ahead of the Japanese
fleet, then,&#8221; Phil hurried on, &#8220;I shall
find Admiral Ting and his ships, show him
the letter from the Wai-Wu-Pu and this letter
the ambassador gave us. After he reads those
he should be willing to follow us and elude
Captain Inaba&#8217;s vessels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where then will you take him?&#8221; Sydney
asked, for he saw that Manila could not be in
Phil&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we convoyed them to Manila we would
put the American admiral into a very embarrassing
position,&#8221; Phil continued. &#8220;I have
thought over it for a long time, Syd, and I
don&#8217;t see why it is not possible. If we can do
it we would make a tremendous hit, a scoop,
as the newspapers say.&#8221; Phil stopped, gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
attentively into the fog while Sydney waited
breathlessly for him to continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Phil,&#8221; Sydney demanded impatiently.
&#8220;What is your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Phil did not have an opportunity to
answer. A great black shape suddenly appeared
out of the fog on their starboard hand.
Every one was on his feet in an instant; the
emergency was so sudden and entirely unexpected.
The loud bellow of a whistle sounded
across the water. For a moment Phil&#8217;s heart
was in his throat. It looked as if the monster
steamer would ram the frail yacht amidships.
Only the &#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; great speed saved
her, and the big merchantman passed close
under the yacht&#8217;s stern, and disappeared as
suddenly into the fog.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, come down into the wireless room,&#8221;
Phil called, a tremor of nervousness still in
his voice.</p>

<p>The sailor quickly obeyed, and together
they went down to the little room where
O&#8217;Neil and Marley had sent out their remarkable
message for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if you can get that steamer,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, &#8220;and ask them if they sighted any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
steamers to-day or yesterday. She has come
from Hongkong, probably, and is on her way
to Yokohama. Don&#8217;t tell them who we are,
of course,&#8221; he added quickly; &#8220;say we&#8217;re
Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded his head and at once began
to make the &#8220;call,&#8221; periodically throwing out
the sending switch and listening through the
wireless head-piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got her, sir,&#8221; he whispered, clicking his
key rapidly as he sent the message.</p>

<p>Then he again threw out the sending key,
and drawing a pencil from his pocket, began
to write rapidly, the words coming in on the
aerial in dots and dashes. The two midshipmen,
for Sydney had joined them, glanced
excitedly over the sailor&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal mail steamer, &#8216;Bombay,&#8217; from London,
<i>via</i> Singapore and Hongkong. What
ship is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Japanese gunboat &#8216;Neko,&#8217;&#8221; Phil exclaimed
quickly, after reading the received message;
&#8220;and now ask if she has sighted anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did ask her, and that&#8217;s her answer,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil replied, throwing in his sending circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
and spelling out what Phil had given
him. &#8220;You see, sir, these fellows want to
know to whom they are giving information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Passed Chinese squadron at Colombo one
week ago. Saw great deal of smoke yesterday
to the northward. Has war been declared
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t seem to be necessary to ask with
whom,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed. &#8220;Apparently
our affairs are being talked of out in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I answer?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them yes, and that Turkey has won
the first victory on the sea,&#8221; Phil directed
calmly, a twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;They make
me tired!&#8221; he exclaimed angrily. &#8220;It looks
as if they were only too anxious to see Japan
and the United States at each other&#8217;s throats.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil sent the message with a gleeful
smile on his face and then quickly penciled
the answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please repeat. Why Turkey? You don&#8217;t
mean the United States, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say &#8216;hardly,&#8217; and then &#8216;good-bye,&#8217; and let
them guess until they reach Yokohama,&#8221; Phil
said savagely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll change our course about a point,&#8221; he
said thoughtfully. &#8220;By to-morrow, if it&#8217;s
clear, we should see the smoke of the Japanese
fleet.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE JAPANESE FLEET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> held a conference with Captain Bailey,
and much against that mariner&#8217;s idea of caution,
the &#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; bow was turned farther to
the westward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking big chances,&#8221; the captain of
the yacht volunteered, &#8220;but that&#8217;s not my affair.
I&#8217;ve my orders from Mr. Impey to go
where you tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey had not failed to notice the change
of course, and very soon afterward approached
Phil as he came aft from the bridge, meanwhile
having consulted Captain Bailey and
seen the course laid down on the chart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are losing valuable time,&#8221; he exclaimed
peevishly. &#8220;You should get in communication
with Manila as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shrugged his shoulders provokingly,
while Impey flushed, his eyes flashing in his
annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey, remember your word given us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
not to interfere with the movements of this
yacht,&#8221; the midshipman replied coldly.
&#8220;There are other staterooms below capable of
being locked, and Marley can attend to two
gentlemen under restraint as easily as one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey saw the fruitlessness of further argument
and subsided with not very good grace.</p>

<p>After supper that evening the fog cleared
away and a breeze sprang up from the northward.
The yacht kept up its rapid pace and
the midshipmen decided that a watch should
be kept by one of them at all times in order
to see that nothing was done either to change
the course or run the yacht into unnecessary
danger. O&#8217;Neil was called and the plan of
watches was told him, Marley continuing
upon his duty of guarding Lieutenant Takishima.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must keep our eyes open for the Japanese
ships,&#8221; Phil explained, &#8220;and yet not get
too close to them. We are running without
lights and should see them sooner than they
will us, for they are not expecting us, while we
are seeking them. They know that we have
eluded the destroyer sent after us, but not
knowing the high speed of the yacht, probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
think that we are much to the northward
and eastward.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, you take the watch until twelve
o&#8217;clock. The compass course set is S. by W.
I don&#8217;t trust Impey&#8217;s influence over Captain
Bailey; so watch the steering. If anything is
sighted call us all at once,&#8221; he said, turning to
the boatswain&#8217;s mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we depend upon these men, Wells and
Randall, in case of an attempt by Impey to
regain the control of the yacht?&#8221; Phil added
questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t very strong on Impey just
now,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate replied. &#8220;I told
them of his intention of getting asylum on the
&#8216;Alaska&#8217; and they felt sore to think he would
have left them here to be pinched by the
Japanese, which would have happened certain
enough if it hadn&#8217;t been that we broke away
before they could stop us. All the same, sir,
I didn&#8217;t give either of them a gun, and I&#8217;ve
collected all the loose firearms in the ship,
and have &#8217;em locked up tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll watch them,&#8221; Phil said decidedly.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be lots they won&#8217;t approve of before
we are through with this adventure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>All three listened eagerly, for they saw in
Phil&#8217;s face that he was about to unfold his
plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bay in the northwest coast of
Paragua Island,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;If we can
pilot the Chinese ships safely in there and
anchor them we can hold the attention of the
world on us without their knowing where on
earth we are.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how long it will be necessary
to keep the location of the ships secret,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;That will depend upon the persuasive
powers of Ambassador Tillotson and
Captain Rodgers, armed with the President&#8217;s
letter, which I feel sure is the key that will
unlock the door of this misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney regarded his companion admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed as much,&#8221; he cried joyfully,
&#8220;when you were interrupted by the sight of
the steamer a short time ago. Phil, you are a
schemer. It&#8217;s the very thing; if it will only
be possible,&#8221; he added as the risks which must
be taken first crossed his mind. He remembered
this bay. It was large enough inside to
anchor a fleet of battle-ships.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil quietly nodded his head&mdash;silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
eloquence which meant much from the sailor.
Marley opened his mouth wider, as if by so
doing the complications might more readily
be heard and elucidated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course if we find the Japanese vessels
are farther south than it seems safe for them
to be, then we cannot run this risk, and must
wire Manila,&#8221; Phil explained earnestly.</p>

<p>The night slipped by quietly. The sea,
stirred to life by the gentle trade wind, caused
the yacht to roll easily but did not lessen her
speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In weather like this she&#8217;s as fast as a
Cunarder,&#8221; Phil exclaimed to Sydney, as they
prepared to go below to their cabins.</p>

<p>The next morning Phil was awakened by a
loud knock on his door and O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s excited
face appeared at the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re somewhere about.&#8221; The boatswain&#8217;s
mate imparted his information hurriedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to tune down to
them on the wireless all morning, since four
o&#8217;clock, and I&#8217;ve just found &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they&mdash;near?&#8221; Phil asked
anxiously, jumping out of his bunk and
hastily dressing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say to that, sir, but if they are only
talking to each other they are not far away.
If they are talking to some one at a distance,
they may not be near us at all.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
closed the door after delivering himself of his
message, to return to the wireless room, while
Phil finished dressing and was soon on deck.</p>

<p>The air was balmy and warm, while myriads
of flying fish could be seen sailing gracefully
over the swelling sea in their mad haste to
escape from this hurrying monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! there you are,&#8221; Sydney called from
the bridge, spy-glass in hand.</p>

<p>Phil hurriedly joined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There appears to be a big bank of smoke
over there,&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing to the
western horizon, &#8220;and a curl of smoke on our
starboard bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil took the glass and gazed eagerly for
several minutes in both directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a scout,&#8221; he said confidently, &#8220;and
if it is, the fleet is where the other smoke is.
I wish I dared go over and investigate,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;but we&#8217;d be between them and might
fall into a trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney nodded his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he exclaimed, catching Phil&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;I can see a lot of columns of smoke there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the strangers were firing up
their boilers. Small black balls of inky smoke
seemed to roll up above the horizon to the
westward and spread out in mushroom shape
above, joined by tiny, hardly discernible stems.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are at least twenty-five ships there if
there&#8217;s one,&#8221; Sydney cried, relieving Phil of
the spy-glass and looking himself long and
eagerly. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty nearly the whole Japanese
fleet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curl of smoke ahead became more distinct
as the yacht overhauled it through her
greater speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more smoke on the port bow,&#8221;
Captain Bailey announced nervously. He did
not seem to be happy in the position of his
vessel. &#8220;The two vessels seem to be drawing
in toward each other, too,&#8221; he added, taking
bearings over the deck compass. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
look good to me.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_358.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THERE ARE AT LEAST<br />
TWENTY-FIVE SHIPS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s pulse beat faster. He saw that the
two vessels, undoubtedly scouts sent ahead of
the main fleet, were not over eight miles apart.
To go in between them meant that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
pass with the yacht within range of their largest
guns. A lucky shot through the engines or
boilers of the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; would spoil everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it wiser to keep away, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
said respectfully but earnestly. The sailor
was standing at the lad&#8217;s elbow, his strong face
showing marked anxiety. It was plain to see
that the boatswain&#8217;s mate believed that Phil
was being too rash.</p>

<p>Phil once more carefully scanned the horizon
ahead to make sure that there were no other
than the two sail already sighted which he had
made up his mind were scouts ahead of the
main fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring the western vessel on the port bow,
captain,&#8221; he ordered quietly. &#8220;You&#8217;re right,
O&#8217;Neil, it&#8217;s a dangerous game to be too rash.
If those are real scouts, they&#8217;re good for twenty-five
knots, and can catch us easily. They
have probably already seen our smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not turn to the eastward and run for
it?&#8221; Sydney suggested anxiously.</p>

<p>Phil did not answer; he was examining the
chart, laying the parallel rulers between the
&#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; plotted position and Hongkong.
He carried it to the compass card printed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
the chart and read the course&mdash;S. W. from their
present position to Hongkong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go S. W. magnetic, captain,&#8221; he
ordered calmly. &#8220;That will bring us up to
the north cape of Formosa, and then we&#8217;ll run
down close to the China coast and get smoother
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this idiotic proceeding!&#8221; The
exclamation in Impey&#8217;s voice, now choked with
passion and fear, made the midshipmen turn
apprehensively. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have us all killed.
Turn her out to sea and let&#8217;s get out of this as
soon as possible,&#8221; he cried in alarmed earnestness,
throwing the timid Chinaman from the
wheel and attempting to put the wheel hard
over to run out to the eastward.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s hand held the spokes rigidly, while
he looked appealingly for orders to forcibly
eject the intruder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold her steady, Captain Bailey,&#8221; Phil
ordered decidedly. &#8220;Mr. Impey,&#8221; he added
calmly, &#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t make it necessary
for us to use force to restrain you on your
own yacht. My mind is made up, and even
if we are to be captured, I&#8217;m determined to
carry the plan out to the end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>&#8220;Slow to twelve knots, Captain Bailey,&#8221;
Phil commanded quietly. &#8220;We must endeavor
to appear to be only what we resemble,
an English gunboat bound for Hongkong.
Our twenty-two knots speed might excite
suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s suicidal!&#8221; Impey exclaimed. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you see that if that is the Japanese fleet, it
will send a ship to look us over, and when it
comes near enough the deception must be
discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s words struck both Sydney and
O&#8217;Neil as being quite sensible. They looked
to Phil to see the effect upon him of Impey&#8217;s
words, but the lad appeared outwardly unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we should turn away now,&#8221; Phil said
stolidly, &#8220;we would arouse their suspicion
and would be chased, and if those vessels on
the bow are twenty-five knot cruiser battle-ships
or scout cruisers we would be soon
overtaken. If we hold our course between
the two scouts and the main body of the
fleet, and allay suspicion by using our wireless,
maybe the Japanese will not believe it
necessary to pay us a closer visit.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>Phil&#8217;s companions were deep in thought,
weighing the plausibility of the two plans,
while Phil continued to gaze to the westward
through the yacht captain&#8217;s binoculars.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bank of fog over there, captain,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked calmly, for he had taken
this into account when he had altered the
course.</p>

<p>Captain Bailey looked long and earnestly,
finally nodding his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Formosa Channel is usually thick,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;There&#8217;s fog there not fifteen
miles away, and thick, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry&#8217;s got the right dope,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed in admiration. &#8220;Shall I go down,
sir, and call them up by wireless?&#8221; he asked
Phil.</p>

<p>Phil nodded, handing the glasses to Sydney,
who also studied the distant fog bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, O&#8217;Neil. Remember this time we are
the British gunboat &#8216;Barracouta&#8217; from a
cruise bound for Hongkong.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the two scouts appeared to have
stopped. Its masts and the top of its smoke-stacks
lifted slowly above the horizon, while
the other&#8217;s smoke gradually dissolved and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
disappeared. The fleet was soon all in sight,
as yet nearly fifteen miles away, but the lofty
spars, smoke-stacks and turrets were visible in
the field of the high power spy-glass.</p>

<p>The midshipmen&#8217;s blood flowed quickly
through their young veins as they looked
upon this martial display. As the yacht&#8217;s
course crossed the track of the oncoming
fleet, the grim battle-ships could be distinguished
to be steaming in two long columns;
the dots of black hovering near the fleet the
lads knew could be nothing else but the
guarding destroyers. The cruiser to the southward
appeared motionless, apparently undecided
what to do, while the other scout had
kept its course and soon passed beyond the
horizon.</p>

<p>Marley came hurriedly on deck with a
paper which he placed in Phil&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ship is that, and where are you
bound?&#8221; he read in O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s handwriting.</p>

<p>A few moments afterward another was
brought forward by the sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steer close to me; I wish to communicate,&#8221;
Phil read with sinking heart. He passed the
paper to Sydney to read. Impey&#8217;s alert eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
read the quick look of anxiety in the midshipmen&#8217;s
faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your blood&#8217;s on your own heads,&#8221; he
cried out angrily, and then suddenly left the
deck. Into his thoughts had come a plan
that might save his precious neck.</p>

<p>The lads were terribly cast down by this
half-expected order from the Japanese scout.
Phil had hoped that his ruse would avail and
that the scout would be satisfied after a
survey at long range that the stranger was only
a cruising British gunboat, and would then go
on its way to the southward. The Japanese,
even if they had heard of the escape of the
yacht, would hardly expect that it could have
steamed to such a distance south in such a
short time.</p>

<p>Then an unpleasant thought upset all this
reasoning. The destroyer which had chased
and caught them only to be eluded in the
fog must have discovered that the &#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221;
speed was greater than that of an ordinary
yacht. At what distance would their disguise
be discovered and the true character of
the vessel be seen?</p>

<p>After Impey had left the bridge he went at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
once to his cabin and locked the door; then
taking a key from a drawer in his desk, he
unlocked another door leading into the next
stateroom, and entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant,&#8221; he whispered, thoroughly
frightened at the contemplation of what
would become of him if he were captured,
&#8220;the yacht is certain to fall into the hands
of your fleet. It is now in sight, and a
scout or armored cruiser has ordered us to
approach. She will soon discover our real
identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima&#8217;s dejected countenance broke into
a smile of great relief, but Impey was too impatient
to allow him to dwell long upon this
happy ending, to his keen disappointment and
failure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fleet cannot obtain the Chinese
ships! That was possible only by intercepting
them before they arrived at Singapore.
The Chinese admiral&#8217;s orders were to wait at
Singapore, and under no circumstances to
issue forth without an order from the Wai-Wu-Pu.
Your admiral cannot seize the ships
in a neutral British port. England would
not allow it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>Takishima gazed earnestly at the anxious
man. He saw that he was in an agony of
terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will promise to allow me to land
safely at Singapore,&#8221; Impey continued, &#8220;I
will guarantee that the Chinese ships receive
orders to sail. The Japanese fleet can then
intercept the squadron after it has passed
through the Singapore Straits into the China
Sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I do not make this promise,&#8221; Takishima
asked eagerly, &#8220;the Chinese ships will
remain at anchor in Singapore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese squadron is due in Singapore
in three days,&#8221; Impey explained anxiously.
&#8220;To-day is the 16th; that will be the 19th. It
is nearly fourteen hundred miles. Your fleet
will need over four days to arrive there.
Meanwhile the destination of the Japanese
fleet must become known, and America will
order her fleet in Manila Bay to proceed to
Singapore. Once there, the exchange can be
made even in a neutral port, because China
has given her consent, which she refused to
give to Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima was puzzled. Would Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
Inaba have set forth with so little chance of
success?</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot make a promise until I am sure
you will be true to your word,&#8221; the lieutenant
said coldly. &#8220;How may we be sure that
you can persuade the Chinese admiral to
sail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have prepared myself for just such an
emergency,&#8221; Impey replied, proud of his duplicity
even in his anxiety over his predicament.
He drew out from his inner pocket a
large envelope, a duplicate of the one he had
given Phil. &#8220;Here is an order from the Wai-Wu-Pu
to the Chinese admiral to turn his
ships over to the Japanese fleet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Takishima stretched out his hand eagerly,
for he recognized distinctly the great yellow
seal of the Dragon Kingdom, but Impey
backed away, the document clutched tightly
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your promise first; the word of a Samurai,&#8221;
he cried earnestly, &#8220;and the paper is
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Takishima could reply a shiver
passed through the frail vessel, and both men
saw at once that the engines, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
only turning over slowly, had suddenly been
set to full speed. Impey, forgetting the
promise he had been so anxious to obtain
from the Japanese naval officer, suddenly
hastened to the deck, and gazed about him.
His eyes encountered a wall of fog into which
the yacht had entered. Off on the port bow
he heard a deep throated whistle, apparently
from the scout cruiser. His pulse beat high
at this sudden and joyful deliverance. He forgot
the young Japanese and the duplicate letter
to the Chinese admiral.</p>

<small>PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> and Sydney were on deck early in the
morning. The fog had continued during the
afternoon and night, and Captain Bailey had
skilfully shaped the &#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; course through
the Formosa Channel. The night had been
uneventful; no vessel had been sighted. The
Americans continued their watches on deck,
still distrusting a conspiracy between Impey
and his friends to get control of the yacht.</p>

<p>But one incident had marred the happiness
of their miraculous escape from the Japanese
scouts. Takishima had been found in the
wireless room by O&#8217;Neil and Marley, attempting
to wreck the plant, and before he had
been discovered and marched back docilely to
his stateroom, he had managed to put the
wireless of the yacht temporarily out of commission.
With the able assistance of Randall,
who was luckily a skilful electrician and whose
aid was enthusiastically given, the wireless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
gear would soon again be in working order.
The avenue of escape from Takishima&#8217;s cabin
through Impey&#8217;s was thereafter sealed by removing
Impey to a cabin at the other end of
the saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now off Hongkong,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
as he saw the penciled position on the chart.
&#8220;In two days we shall be nearing Singapore,
and then for the success or failure of our
plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s face beamed with pleasure, but a
cloud crossed it as he thought of poor, dejected,
disappointed Takishima in his cabin below.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we might win Taki over,&#8221; he said
charitably. &#8220;He takes defeat so bitterly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil remained silently thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I see the way,&#8221; he replied after
a lapse of a few minutes. &#8220;When he sees
that his fleet has failed and that there is no
chance for our seizure, then he may be more
amenable to common sense. The Japanese
fighting class represented now in the army
and navy, the Samurai of old, have a very
lofty sense of honor. Taki would without a
personal thought sink or blow up this vessel
if he believed by so doing he could aid his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
government in its plans. That is why it was
necessary to constrain him. If we had not
discovered him in the wireless room yesterday
just after the fog shut down, the thing upon
which our plan principally depends would
have been wrecked beyond repair; for during
only a few minutes his destructive work was
marvelous, and he knew the most important
things to destroy. Fortunately there were
spare parts in the storeroom and Randall,
who seems to be an all around handy man, is
doing wonders to repair the damage. Hereafter
Taki must be watched more closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;From now on we must keep a watch on
Impey, too,&#8221; Phil continued, a happy smile on
his face. &#8220;He asked me only a moment ago
if I thought we could call up Manila yet. He
counts on our wirelessing the admiral and
expects he will sail at once to an appointed
rendezvous, and that we will then intercept
the Chinese ships and lead them to this
rendezvous. He asked me if that was not my
plan. When he knows our real intention he
will be mad enough to attempt anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221; Sydney asked,
catching Phil&#8217;s joyful spirit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;I said how clever he was to have guessed
it; and then added I hoped we should have
the wireless working very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day passed pleasantly enough on board
the yacht; the fog had cleared away, eaten
up by the sun, long before noon. A few curls
of smoke had been sighted, but no vessel
crossed their track close enough to show even
the top of its funnel.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Marley had formed a strong
liking for Randall, who had shown himself
willing to atone for past misdeeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he had exclaimed in the
strictest confidence while they were both
working to repair the damage caused by Takishima&#8217;s
few minutes of liberty, &#8220;when a
fellow gets down on his luck in a foreign
country, his sense of right and wrong suffers
a blight. He can&#8217;t recognize the difference
until it&#8217;s pointed out to him. I thought it
was fine to vilify my country and countrymen,
baiting the Japanese bull, as it were. I
got good pay for it, and it all went home to
my mother.&#8221; Here he lowered his voice, and a
wistful look came into his eyes. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
know that the money was tainted, and besides,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
he added softly, &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t any
money coming from anywhere else, and she
was very much in need of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil put out a strong, honest hand and
placed it on Randall&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t for the likes of me to blame you,
son,&#8221; he said, an imperceptible trace of moisture
in his eye that made him wink. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
say you didn&#8217;t do wrong, for you did, and
you knew it, but when a man is sorry and
honestly says so, and besides has a lonely
mother to take care of, then I&#8217;m for saying no
more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall derived no small comfort from the
sailor&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate suddenly
asked, &#8220;where&#8217;s that Filipino who
nearly caused a free fight in the theatre?&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turned up missing the night we sailed,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;I think he swam ashore. There
was some talk of going to Manila, and I believe
he&#8217;s wanted there by the government for some
crime, an outlaw probably; he looks the part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who instigated the theatre row?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>&#8220;Our chief, Impey. That man can do anything
he tries to do,&#8221; Randall began, when O&#8217;Neil
interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything deceitful and underhanded, you
mean,&#8221; the sailor exclaimed, with fire in his
eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;d give a month&#8217;s pay to be allowed
to throttle him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that&#8217;s finished,&#8221; Randall exclaimed
as he rose from the tuning device. He put
on the head-gear and listened earnestly,
moving the pointer back and forward in an
endeavor to detect something which would
tell him that the receiving circuit was complete.
He pushed the buzzer with his finger
and remained silent for several minutes afterward.
&#8220;Just a faint tinkle,&#8221; he said finally.
&#8220;Some one&#8217;s talking in Hongkong, probably,
but it&#8217;s too faint to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil went to report that all was in shape,
while Randall locked up the room and put
the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; was now near the latitude
of Manila, and the lads and O&#8217;Neil could
hardly resist the temptation to call up the
admiral&#8217;s ship. Impey hung about them all
evening, frequently asking them when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
intended giving the admiral a report on the
condition of affairs, for at midnight Manila
would be only two hundred and fifty miles
to the eastward, well within the sending range
of the &#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; wireless. But the lads
would not enlighten him, and at last he became
desperate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might as well inform you now as any
time,&#8221; Phil exclaimed after many appeals,
&#8220;that I am not going to tell the admiral until
the Chinese squadron is anchored where
neither nation can find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey could not believe his ears. Had the
lad gone mad? What was his meaning?</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese squadron,&#8221; Phil added, &#8220;is
going to sink metaphorically into the earth
until all misunderstandings are over, and then
like the Ph&#339;nix it will rise from its ashes
and go to China, where it belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But China doesn&#8217;t want it. She fears it
on account of the internal disorders, and is
anxious to be rid of the ships and their cost,&#8221;
Impey exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;ll have to keep it until she can
find some one anxious to buy,&#8221; Phil replied,
tantalizingly calm despite the nervous irritability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
of his listener. &#8220;The United States
doesn&#8217;t really want it, and Japan doesn&#8217;t,
either; so why force a sale on a nation that
is unwilling to buy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey threw up his hands in angry disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you have gone back
on your compact with me?&#8221; he cried in much
heat. &#8220;After taking my yacht, offered you
for this purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Impey,&#8221; Phil answered calmly, &#8220;I
have made you no promise. There is no
agreement between you and me; there could
be none. You offered the yacht; you outlined
a plan. I listened only. On the other hand,&#8221;
he added, his voice rising in his earnestness,
&#8220;you promised that you would not interfere
with my plans, and you have broken your
word. Remember there is a key to your
cabin, and as I said before, Marley can look
out for two prisoners as readily as one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spy saw that it would only do himself
harm to follow further his quarrel with Phil.
The lad was obdurate. Impey saw all his
work in Japan, stretching over a year, going
for naught. It was bitter to contemplate the
result, but there seemed no visible relief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>The two days following were entirely uneventful.
As Singapore was approached a
feeling of dread came over both lads. Suppose,
after all, the Chinese squadron should
evade them. The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; had been unsuccessful
in its attempts to talk with them by
wireless.</p>

<p>&#8220;If their wireless gear is working, they
won&#8217;t answer,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil told Phil the evening
of the fifth day out, while they were approaching
Singapore Straits.</p>

<p>It was just breaking day when the white
clustered buildings of the city of Singapore
loomed up out of the tropical darkness. As
day slowly drew on, the vast shipping in the
harbor took shape. The lads and O&#8217;Neil
eagerly watched while the harbor, like a bud
opening to the sun, became slowly revealed to
their eager eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a man-of-war there!&#8221; Phil
exclaimed in keen disappointment. &#8220;What
had we best do&mdash;wait here, or intercept them
farther down the Straits of Malacca?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sir, for making a suggestion,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil said quietly in Phil&#8217;s ear. &#8220;I think
Mr. Impey would be safer locked up. I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
like his actions. He approached both Randall
and Wells in a roundabout way to sound
them out if they&#8217;d help him, and he&#8217;s been
very thick with the dago engineer. It ain&#8217;t
hard to get a hot bearing on these turbines, I
hear. Stop the oil flow and it burns up in
five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil did not hesitate in his decision a moment.
He had been awaiting only a corroboration
of his own belief as to what should
be done with Impey. A disablement at this
time would be disastrous. The Chinese squadron
might be delayed some days, and meanwhile
Japan&#8217;s port scouts might appear at
any time. Phil had more than feared that
they might already be on the scene, awaiting
in the straits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you attend to it, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil said
at once, &#8220;and look into the engineer&#8217;s intentions,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil held O&#8217;Neil in high regard for his
ability in handling men. He would soon
find out if the engineer were worthy of trust,
and if not, O&#8217;Neil had a way of intimidation
that seemed to take with the rascals he
encountered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; sped by Singapore and out
into the Straits of Malacca. The Americans
were eating their noon meal when the joyful
news was received that the Chinese squadron
was in sight ahead.</p>

<p>The midshipmen, as they stood on the
bridge of the yacht, gazing in admiration at
these mighty fortresses with their small watchdog
destroyers hovering solicitously near, could
not repress a thrill of wonder and relief; wonder
at their majesty and power, and relief that
this priceless prize was not to be the cause
of a useless struggle at arms by two friendly
nations.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; approached the Chinese
squadron at an incredible speed, and it was
only a short time after the Americans had
reached the deck before the yacht had gone
by the squadron whose dragon flags waved
proudly in the bright tropical sunshine, and
had turned and glided up to the side of the
leading ship.</p>

<p>Signals by the international code had been
exchanged, and the Chinese flag-ships had
stopped to communicate with the yacht.</p>

<p>A boat was quickly lowered from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
&#8220;Sylvia&#8221; and lay manned at the gangway.</p>

<p>Phil, before entering the boat, went to Takishima&#8217;s
cabin. He told the crestfallen lieutenant
his entire plan and appealed to his fairness
to join him and Sydney in this humane
enterprise. But Takishima remained unshaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perry,&#8221; he exclaimed earnestly, &#8220;my
father is a Samurai, and if he had failed as I
have, he would have committed hara-kiri ere
this; but the modern spirit has made me a
coward. Three times I have taken my short
dagger to end my worthless life, but each time
I have tricked myself into believing that yet I
might serve my Emperor. Now all hope is
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil showed a grave face as he heard these
solemn words, and before Takishima could
read his intentions had snatched up the sharp
dirk from the bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must leave me my honor,&#8221; his old
classmate cried, reaching out appealingly for
his dagger, which Phil had quickly passed to
the faithful Marley outside.</p>

<p>Phil was in a fever of dread lest the super-sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
Japanese should put an end to his
life, and asked O&#8217;Neil to guard him, and then
entering the waiting boat he, Sydney and
Impey were soon on their way to visit Admiral
Ting, the Chinese commander of the squadron.
Impey had been released and taken along, for
Phil believed that there might be some question
raised in regard to the authenticity of the
letter from the Wai-Wu-Pu.</p>

<p>They were cordially received at the gangway
of the flag-ship by Admiral Ting himself,
and escorted to his cabin.</p>

<p>Phil promptly handed him the letter from
the Wai-Wu-Pu and as he read in silence, the
midshipmen were prepared to see a look of
surprised annoyance on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew when we sailed from Suez that my
ships were for sale,&#8221; he said bitterly, raising
his eyes from the letter, &#8220;and if China cannot
retain these magnificent ships, you will believe
me sincere when I say that I am glad that
America will own them.&#8221; Admiral Ting spoke
in perfect English. &#8220;There seems nothing for
me to do but obey this order. It is from the
highest authority of my country and commands
me to place myself immediately upon its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
receipt under the protection of the Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impey&#8217;s presence had been quite overlooked
by the midshipmen. The document was not
challenged. There had been therefore no
reason to have brought him. How much
simpler and certainly with less annoyance if
he had been sent to the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; as he had
desired. Now the midshipmen were to seriously
regret their blunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admiral Ting, will you also read this letter?&#8221;
Impey said, his voice triumphant, while
he glared at the discomfited lads, for they at
once saw the documents were identical in appearance.</p>

<p>Admiral Ting received the second letter and
the surprise the lads had looked for now was
only too evident in his face as he read its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean? This commands
me to place myself under the protection of the
Japanese,&#8221; he exclaimed, much mystified.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were dumbfounded. A
silence had fallen and each looked to the other
for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have another letter,&#8221; Phil said in a hopeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
voice. &#8220;Our ambassador gave it to me before
we sailed from Japan. It&#8217;s from your
ambassador there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Admiral Ting broke the seal and read.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this cannot be called an order,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;It is only advice from an old and
trusted friend. He advises me to put myself
under the protection of the American fleet in
Manila until Japan and the United States can
adjust their differences. Unhappily my country
is now harassed by a threatened civil war,
and the Peking government fears that those
opposing the dynasty may seize my ships.
They little know our loyalty,&#8221; he added with
tears in his eyes. &#8220;They do not trust us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt the success of his plans was fast
slipping away. Impey appeared jubilant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I would advise, admiral,&#8221;
Impey said in an oily voice. &#8220;The American
admiral will be glad to protect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was hot and cold in turns. To go now
to Manila with the ships might mean war, and
also there was strong probability of their falling
into the hands of the Japanese fleet on the way.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>BY WIRELESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> gazed at Sydney for an inspiration.
How could he persuade this clever Chinaman?
For he read his intelligence in his face. Why
not confide to him his entire plan? The
possibility of keeping these ships, of which the
lad saw he was proud to the point of conceit,
might be a potent factor.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I have here two conflicting letters
from the Wai-Wu-Pu,&#8221; Admiral Ting said,
after a painful silence, &#8220;my duty is quite
plain. I must use my own discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Admiral Ting,&#8221; Phil exclaimed suddenly,
finding his voice at last, &#8220;if you will hear
my plan, I can save your ships for China and
defeat the aims of this scheming rascal.&#8221;
Phil&#8217;s face was flushed as he pointed an accusing
finger at Impey. &#8220;There is a harbor on
the coast of Paragua in the Philippine Islands.
The entrance is narrow, but with sufficient
water for a battle-ship, and inside, your ships
can anchor securely and be invisible from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
outside.&#8221; The lad&#8217;s voice was eager and
earnest and made a visible impression on the
Chinaman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the channel, having been there on
a small gunboat and made a survey of the
bay; I can pilot you in. There we can make
terms with the world by wireless without
either of the disputing countries discovering
our whereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; Impey exclaimed with
a harsh laugh, &#8220;you must see that this is
the talk of a romantic boy. It is unlikely
that there is any such place, and from my
knowledge of the coast of Paragua Island, I
would advise you not to risk your ships. It
is a rocky and dangerous coast, and the charts
are worse than useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil would have answered Impey&#8217;s sally
by a denial, but Admiral Ting&#8217;s answer made
it unnecessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, I will follow you,&#8221; he said
quietly, rising from his chair and escorting
them to the gangway, where their boat was
waiting. &#8220;If we are successful you will have
won the thanks of three nations and the applause
of the civilized world.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>&#8220;And the dislike of a denationalized
rascal,&#8221; Phil added with joy in his voice and
a triumphant glance at the discomfited
Impey as they passed down the gangway
into the waiting boat.</p>

<p>With the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; leading, the Chinese
squadron steamed through the Singapore
Straits and out into the China Sea. All the
world soon knew that the coveted squadron
had passed the city of Singapore, for it was
cabled from there to every country. Then it
disappeared as completely as if it had been
swallowed up by the sea; days passed, and no
news came of its arrival in any port.</p>

<p>It was the great mystery of the hour. The
newspapers strained every effort and spared
no expense to discover its whereabouts but
without success.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; had steered northwest, heading
directly for the unknown bay on the
coast of the Island of Paragua. A close watch
was kept both during the day and night for
the smoke of other vessels, but the course
taken was so far out of the regular track of
steamers plying between ports in the Orient
that luckily none were sighted. The midshipmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
desired that no eye should discover
the position and destination of the squadron
for fear that it would inform the world and
cause searching war-ships to be sent to bring
them back to civilization.</p>

<p>On the third day, after leaving Singapore,
the high, densely-wooded coast of Paragua
Island loomed before them, and before sunset
the entire Chinese squadron had been piloted
to a safe anchorage inside Malampaya Sound.
Once inside, as Phil had said, the ships were
as if at anchor in an inland lake. The sea
was not visible and there were no signs of life
ashore. The beach of the bay was lined with
dense and impenetrable mangrove bushes, and
back of that was the primeval forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are as completely cut off from the
outside world as if we had landed on the
planet Mars,&#8221; Phil exclaimed gleefully as he
and Sydney returned from the Chinese flag-ship
to the yacht. &#8220;Now we must possess
our souls in patience; it would not do to
communicate yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil read the inquiry in Sydney&#8217;s face, so
he continued to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were seen passing Singapore three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
days ago, and if we used our wireless now to
let the world know we are still on the earth,
those with an analytical mind could figure out
just how far from Singapore we must have
come, and then a search might prove disastrous
to our plans. The situation is one our
rich newspapers would delight to unravel;
they would spare no expense to find us by
chartering if need be every steamship in the
Orient and sending them out to hunt us
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney nodded in ready understanding of
the soundness of his friend&#8217;s reasoning.</p>

<p>The wireless apparatus of the Chinese ships,
by Admiral Ting&#8217;s orders, had been completely
dismantled to be sure that no accident
could mar the midshipmen&#8217;s plans. Phil had
feared that some enemy might exist among
the ships who could during the watches of
the night send out to the many listening
stations bordering the China Sea, the much
sought intelligence as to the location of the
Chinese squadron.</p>

<p>The wireless of the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; alone was in
working order, and the two sailormen and
the midshipmen took turns both by day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
night in the little wireless room. Every message
heard through the telephone receiver
was written down and read.</p>

<p>From these mysterious messages grasped
from the boundless air the lads heard of the
consternation throughout the world. &#8220;Where
is the Chinese squadron?&#8221; was on every lip.
They learned that the Japanese fleet had
arrived at Singapore, where the ships had
coaled from their colliers, and after a few
days of indecision had sailed again, steering
to the northward.</p>

<p>The United States fleet had remained quietly
at anchor in Manila Bay.</p>

<p>Takishima, during these long days of waiting,
had been allowed his freedom, and as
the days passed, the sadness slowly gave way
to cheerfulness and amusement at the ludicrous
situation. Impey, with all his villainy,
had openly congratulated the midshipmen
upon their masterful control of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth losing to have witnessed it,&#8221; he
exclaimed as he read the messages faithfully
recorded by the sailormen in the wireless
room. Over a week dragged slowly by, and
the anxious wait told on the midshipmen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>The Chinese admiral came on board the
yacht daily, and the more the lads came to
know him the more they respected and liked
him. He was the type of the Oriental that
was fast being born out of that kingdom of
antiquity, unfettered by the prejudices of conservatism.
A new and enlightened China had
been his purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been waiting for,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil called out at last from the wireless
room, his voice joyful and triumphant,
while Phil met the boatswain&#8217;s mate
in the salon waving a paper on which had
been roughly penciled a message just intercepted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Manila was sending it to our admiral; he
is somewhere in the southern islands of the
Philippines,&#8221; the sailor exclaimed, handing
Phil the paper. &#8220;He&#8217;s looking for us, I
guess,&#8221; he added with a grin.</p>

<p>The lad received it, his hand trembling
with excitement, and read aloud the words
with a fast beating heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States and Japan have concluded
a treaty of better understanding over
affairs in the Far East. Each has disclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
any intention of acquiring the lost Chinese
squadron.&#8221;</p>

<p>The paper fluttered from Phil&#8217;s hand to the
deck and a faintness suddenly came over him.
But on his young face a great joy was written
as he aroused himself and actually hugged
the astonished O&#8217;Neil.</p>

<p>Sydney and Marley stood by, their faces
wreathed in happy smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signal this to the Chinese admiral at once,
Syd,&#8221; Phil cried joyfully, &#8220;and come on,
O&#8217;Neil; we&#8217;ll call up our admiral and solve
the mystery of the Chinese squadron.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days afterward the new Chinese navy,
with their dragon banners fluttering in the
breeze, steamed toward their own country.
Admiral Ting wrung the midshipmen&#8217;s hands
warmly in parting, and heaped upon them
many handsome gifts from artistic China, declaring
that his Emperor would decorate them
with the &#8220;Order of the Dragon&#8221; for their
great service to the Dragon Kingdom.</p>

<p>It was with hearts full of joy that they
turned the bow of the &#8220;Sylvia&#8221; northward
with Yokohama as their destination. Impey
and his co-conspirators had been sent away on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
the Chinese ships. Randall and Wells were
truly penitent, and told O&#8217;Neil that hereafter
they would live honest lives. Impey was
game to the last, only remarking as he was
bidden a cold good-bye by the Americans
that &#8220;one couldn&#8217;t always win.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor, disconsolate Takishima! He alone
was the one thorn in the midshipmen&#8217;s happiness.</p>

<p>On the way north the lads sent a long cipher
message to the &#8220;Alaska,&#8221; telling of Takishima&#8217;s
loyalty in his Emperor&#8217;s cause. The
message was to Captain Inaba as the friend of
all concerned.</p>

<p>The following morning Phil and Sydney
entered Takishima&#8217;s cabin. The lieutenant
was sitting with his head in his hands, while
on his face was an expression of great sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a message for you, Taki,&#8221; Phil said,
his voice trembling with joy.</p>

<p>Takishima took the paper from Phil&#8217;s hand
and cast his eyes listlessly over the first line.
Then his face relaxed and he drew himself up
smartly, reading now quickly and eagerly the
words before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To Lieutenant Takishima</span>,<br />
<span class="indentleft">&#8220;<i>via</i> U. S. S. &#8216;<span class="smcap">Alaska</span>.&#8217;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty our Emperor has commanded
me to inform you that your zeal,
patriotism and good judgment under trying
circumstances, which have come to his august
notice, have caused him to honor you with
the &#8216;Order of the Rising Sun of the First
Class&#8217; and appoint you one of His Majesty&#8217;s
naval aides. I take pleasure in congratulating
you on your high good fortune.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Kamikura</span>,</span><br />
&#8220;<i>Minister of Marine</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Then for several minutes after he had
finished, his head remained sunk on his breast
and his eyes on the floor. Phil had laid his
hand affectionately on his shoulder, while in his
eyes was a slight trace of manly tears. Takishima
turned and both lads saw the joy in his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve it,&#8221; he said humbly, &#8220;and
I owe His Majesty&#8217;s clemency to you, I feel
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To your own high sense of honor and
patriotism to your Emperor,&#8221; Phil answered
earnestly.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the day after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
&#8220;Sylvia&#8217;s&#8221; arrival in Yokohama, the &#8220;Alaska&#8221;
was to return to Manila to rejoin the fleet,
which was under orders to return to the
United States. If the &#8220;Alaska&#8221; had stayed
longer it is sure that the midshipmen&#8217;s heads
would have been completely turned by the
many honors heaped upon them.</p>

<p>On the night before sailing there was given
a large dinner by Admiral Kamikura, the
memory of which remained long in Phil&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<p>His neighbors at the table were Helen and
Takishima, and the atmosphere was electric
with good fellowship. No cloud marred the
clear sky of understanding.</p>

<p>After the dinner there was a small party
collected at the embassy to bid farewell to the
ambassador and his daughter, and to them the
midshipmen told the full story of the cruise of
the &#8220;Sylvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until the Japanese fleet had arrived
in Singapore and reported no trace of
the Chinese squadron that we were sure that
you had been successful,&#8221; Captain Rodgers explained
after Phil had recounted the adventure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>&#8220;And then in five days more, and meanwhile
nothing had been heard from the
&#8216;phantom fleet,&#8217; as it was called in the
American newspapers,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;we
heard that the Japanese fleet had returned
to Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the Minister of Marine came to me,&#8221;
the ambassador took up the thread of the
story where Captain Rodgers had left off,
&#8220;and asked if Captain Rodgers and I still desired
the audience with the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assured him above all things it was
desired, and the next day the audience was an
accomplished fact and the new treaty the
outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ambassador beamed down upon the
attentive midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great pity our government will not
allow our officials to accept foreign orders,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;I am sure if it did, the &#8216;Alaska&#8217;
would sail away from Japan loaded down
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Bill Marley had returned to the
armored cruiser but had been allowed to return
to Tokyo to attend a dinner given to
O&#8217;Neil by his old friend &#8220;Billy&#8221; Williams.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
The crowds that gathered about the little
restaurant to catch a glimpse of the two noted
sailors was one of the biggest advertisements
&#8220;Billy&#8221; Williams ever had.</p>

<p>But all things must have an end, and the
happy party at the ambassador&#8217;s could be no
exception. Good-byes were said and the carriages
were waiting.</p>

<p>Phil found himself alone with Helen only
for the fraction of a minute, but in that time
among other favors he had been given a certain
gold locket that he valued more than
any foreign decoration that might have been
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Takishima and Captain Inaba met the
party at the railroad station and escorted
them to a special train, and as they pulled
out from the long platform the midshipmen&#8217;s
last glimpse was of their two friends, hats
in hand above their heads, crying loudly
&#8220;Banzai&#8221;&mdash;ten thousand years of happiness!</p>

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
